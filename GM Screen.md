##  Macwhirr, Officer
- Buddy : Singleton
- Rival : Hirsch

### Agenda 
- You don’t show it, but you love the people of Hadley’s Hope.

- Agent Reynolds and her science lackey Kominskey must pay for their crimes.

## Hirsch, Ex-Marine

## Singleton, Pilot
- Buddy : Macwhirr
- Rival : Hirsch

### Agenda 
- You are a Weyland-Yutani sleeper agent. 
- Holroyd is a Company android, but he doesn’t know you are on the payroll. He’s suspected of disobeying company orders, so keep any eye on him.
- Also, news of this outbreak cannot be allowed to leak, even if it means putting an end to any of your “friends” that try to escape...

## Sigg, Scientist
- Buddy : Hirsch
- Rival : Macwhirr

### Agenda 
- That Weyland-Yutani inspection team won’t be so snooty if you can leapfrog them and get an alien to the Company first. 
- You just need to get a live specimen and get off LV-426 alive. Who will be laughing then?

## Holroyd, Roughneck
- Buddy : Hirsch
- Rival : Sigg

### Agenda 
- You know about the alien ship that crashed on LV-426, the alien eggs within, and why Miranda is here. 
- You should cover it up, but you feel a terrible responsibility for what has happened. 
- You must do everything you can to save your comrades, including sacrificing yourself, if need be.
