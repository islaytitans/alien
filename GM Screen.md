# Dice Rolls

- Base Dice: Attribute + Skill + Gear.
- Stress Dice: 1s trigger PANIC ROLLS which may cancel action
- Difficulty Modifiers: Adjust # of dice (Base Dice first, then Stress Dice).
- Results: A 6 = success. Each additional 6 can be used to buy Stunts.
- Pushing: If no 1s show on Stress Dice, you may add 1 STRESS LEVEL (and the associated die) then reroll all non-6s.

# Story points

- Gain 1 (max 3) by playing your agenda
- Awarded at end of each act
- Spend to add one Success to a roll

# Measuring time

Remember to keep track of time in stealth and combat

| Unit | Duration | Primary Use |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Round | 5-10 seconds | Combat |
| Turn | 5-10 minutes | Stealth |
| Shift | 5-10 hours | Recovery |

# Sequence of combat 

Once enemy is revealed stealth mode is over and combat begins.

1. Determine initative
    - do this before anyone rolls dice except for sneak attack
2. Shuffle initiative cards
3. Draw cards for every PC and NPC
    - PCs and NPCs are given card per point of speed. Humans have speed of 1
    - if more than 10 then group NPCs
    - PC can swap initiative cards at beginning or end of round
4. Round begins each participant act in ascending initiative order
5. On your act perform either
    - one slow action and one fast action
    - two fast actions
6. On another participant act you can perform a reaction
    - but this uses up your actions for this round
7. Once every participant has acted a new round begins
