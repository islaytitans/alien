# Chariot of the Gods 2

## Party

## Session Open

- Read what's the story mother
- Remind roll are less often than d&d only when failure has significant impact
- Give agenda cards
  - Decide who is 'Lucas' and give their agenda card instead of the Normal Agenda Card with the 'Note to Lucas'
  - Give Wilson Special order 966 too
- [Start on Montero](#openning)

## Locations

## Montero

> Map p7

> Gear p6

- Same class as the Nostromo but untable to tow cargo due to smaller engines. Instead it's hauled internally

### Cargo

- Contains 72 high pressure tanks containing 200,000 tones of aging but still flammable and volatile Tritium
  - Once Montero reaches destination it will be harmless Helium-3
- Montero has an ailing WY-37B 34 meter Flatbed cargo shuttle called Daisy to move the cargo

### Passageway Umbilical

- 10 meter passage to connect airlocks with another spacecraft

## Cronus

- Space exploration vehicle launched in 22nd centry similiar to Prometheus
- Consists of 4 decks accessible through main junction ladderways, two large elevators, and a collapsed staircase
- Contains a separate science lab module that can be jettisoned in an emergency. The module is missing at the start of the adventure
- All escape pods are missing
- All vehicles are missing except for 2 ATVs
- Environment
  - Cold : When PCs arrive interior is a deep freeze. If PCs open their suits before life support system they will become **FREEZING** and need to make **STAMINA** rolls against the cold once per turn
  - Dark : Until MU/TH/UR 2000 comes online the interior is lit only by weak emergency light (all zones count as dark)
  - Air : Until MU/TH/UR online, air scrubbers powered and cleaned the air is stale and high concentration of carbon dioxide. All **STAMINA** -2 until fixed.
  - Gravity : Artificial gravity still works
  - Decompression : Outer hull has Armor Rating 6. Shots that miss target in an area with an exterior wall will cause explosive decompression (p73 CRB). Doors and vents to compartment are auto-closed and permanetly sealed after one round
- Doors
  - All doors can be opened at a push of a button unless otherwise stated
  - Some doors can only be opened by MU/TH/UR or by using an encrypted key card carried by Wilson and Clayton. Can also be found in Science Lab 1, dropped by Ava

## Cronus Cryo Deck A

### Main Airlock, Junction A-1

- Only entry point into the Cronus
- When viewed from outside the outer airlock door is damaged as if buckled from inside
- Opening it requires a torch and **HEAVY MACHINERY** once open can't close it
- Once breached need Montero's passsageway umbilical to the Cronus to pressurize before opening inside airlock door.
  - If damaged explosive decompression happens
- Airlock junction leads down to Deck B and Deck C its covered in scuff and scratch marks

### MU/TH/UR 2000 Mainframe

- Protected area requires entering a command sequence or the emergency access key
  - Things only Wilson, Johns and Cooper have at the beginning of the scenario
- Clean, blinking server room with one terminal which highest-ranking member of a crew can use to talk to MU/TH/UR

### Air Scrubbers

- Currently offline when the PCs arrive. It's dark and water is frozen
- Only accessible via ventilation and maintenance shafts
- When operational it cleans the air and generate oxygen via electrolysis
- Powered directly by direct feed from reactors, the shaft ends in water filled chamber on Deck C. Condensation forms here and rains down here
- Once MU/TH/UR goes online and power is restored the scrubbers become active and ice melts
  - It is very noisy **Observation -2** here
  - Risk of electrocution in here - failed skill roll results in immediate attack rolled with **six Base Dice and Damage 1**
- **Heavy Machinary** and shift worth of work to clean the carbon filters from grime/mold to bring oxygen level to normal
  - If PCs actively examine filters they will see Neomorphic Egg Scacs p39 growing on them.
  - If distrubed the Neomorphic Motes are released throughout the ship
  - Only way to remove eggs sacs is to burn them. Ava 6 can explain

### Elevators

- Provide access to vehicle bay
- Elevator 1 functions fine once power is restored although contains bulletholes and dried blood
- Elevator 2 shaft doors are open and the elevator is crumpled on the vehicle bay level. Looks like someone threw incendiary grenades

### Cryo chambers

- Main door into this area has claw marks as if something was trying to get in
- Door is locked from the inside requiring **Heavy Machinery** to open
- Cryobeds are covered in frost, most are empty, two broken ones contain husks of bodies but inside some are the sleeping surviving crew of the Cronus
- Once life support is online the crew wakes up p28
- Lockers here contain personal gear of the Cronus

### Examination Room

- Room is a mess but contains two **Medkits**

### Showers

- Showers are filthy and some Neomorphic egg sacs are growing on the drains

### Junction A-2

- Shaft leads to other levels of the ship

### Eva Storage 1 & 2

- Three remaining spacesuits are here - older models of the IRC Mk.50 Compression Suit
- They have not been tampered with and function fine

## Cronus Main Deck B

### Armory

- Mostly stripped bare with a splatter of dried milky-white spray on the wall from Ava's encounter she had with an Abomination
- 1 x M41A Pulse Rifle but **heavy**
- 1 x shotguns shell case

### Junction B-1

- Ladder is undamaged and all doors work

### Vestibules

- Next to Junction B-1 are two bays for escape bods which are both missing
- Bulky red EVA ECO All-Worlds Survival Suits (p92 CRB) suits can be mistaken as a stalker if the lights are still off

### Bridge

- Until power is restored the bridge is on battery and is shutdown with a low standby lights glow
- Blast shutters are still lowered and locked over the viewports
- There is soot on the ceiling and serveral stations are burned out
- Command Station
  - Once power is restored Command Station will be functional
  - Captain's Station has a small panel that contains MU/TH/UR emergency access key but the glass is broken and the key is missing
  - Captain's Station hold "at a glance" info on the consoles
  - If PCs access the command station and make **COM-TECH** roll they'll find out where the Cronus has been; on a distant, uncharted planet in the 26 Draconis system
- Holographic Display Table
  - Slagged and brunt out hologram tech beyond repair
- Sensor station
  - Damaged by the fire but can be repaired with a **COM-TECH** and Shift of work
  - Damaged senors sporadically pick up [sensor ghost](#sensor-ghost-redux)
- Life Support Monitors
  - When power is restored the monitors will flash red due to the high carbon dioxide levels
  - It says maintenance must be performed on the air scrubbers either [replaced](#bad-air)
  - If PCs talk to MU/TH/UR before restoring power to this terminal she shares the same info
- Pilot Station
  - An axe is embedded in Station 1 and Station 2 is dead regardless if the power is restored
  - It is possible to open up the deck plating and try to reconnect power **HEAVY MACHINERY** for one Shift of work
  - Faster, easier solution would be to cannibalize Station 2 to repair sation 1 **COM-TECH +2** for one shift of work
  - Only one pilot station is needed to fly the ship

### Crew Quarters

- All rooms are locked tight, ranascked, or smell like death
- Small personal items of worth can be found here but the crew of the Cronus won't be happy if taken

### Mess Hall

- Food stores are ravaged and most of the exposed food stores are rotten
- Someone had been making origami anmals out of metallic paper and setting them up around the room
- These animals are made by Ava in her deranged state

### Corporate Suite

- Clayton's wardroom and quarters is spacious and was luxurious but now a ruin with blood on the bed, sofa storn apart and furniture is destroyed
- Drugs
  - Under the mattress is a pack of illegal stimulants to be injected into the ocular cavity. Reduces **STRESS LEVEL** to 0. D6 doses
- Wall Safe
  - Only accessible via Clayton's code containing
    - encrypted Modular Computing Device cube storing all data on the science mission to LV-1113
    - 1 million dollars in cash
  - Without code the safe can be cracked **COM-TECH -3** and 1 shift of work
  - The door can be blown open with an explosion with **BLAST POWER 12** which damages the cube and destorys most of the cash
- Wetbar
  - Bar is cleaved in two and most bottles are destroyed
- Closet / Escape Pod
  - Anyone examining the closet realises that it also functions as an EEV - escape pod
  - Escape Pod is functional but can only be accessed with Clayton's code
  - Escape Pod has three cryo-pods but not FTL capable

### Med Lab

- MedPod
  - Two Pauling Medpods (p100 CRB) and specimen jars containing floating Bloodbursters (p40)
  - One is shattered as if something broke out of it
    - Works **MEDICAL AID + 3** but risks sepsis (roll **Virulence 6** p75 CRB)
  - One is sealed and lit from within but the entire surface is covered in thick dried blood
    - Can be opened and it contains a **dead Stage IV Abomination** that was vivisectioned with is sckull and chest cavity open. Getting too close it'll have one last gasp and attack the PC but killed easily (3 Health no Armor)
  - They were included on this mission specifically for removing parasite organisms
- Another jar without liquid contains fungal nodes (Neomorphic Egg Sacs)
- Metalic Urn
  - Next to that jar is an open metalic urn containing 4 organic-looking vials. 3 are intact containing black liquid, the 4th is broken and empty
  - The vials need to be kept in cold storage. If it starts to sweat it'll release the black liquid and will affect the PCs
- The Cure
  - Under desk is a medikit containing 6 syringes full of 26 Draconis Strain derivative - a cure of being infected with Meomorphic Motes
- Bloodbursters
  - Two Bloodbursters in the jars are dead. They were surgically removed from their victims by the Medpods but killing both the infected and the Neomorph
- Motes
  - If Egg Sacs disturbed motes will eject and try to find a host but dying if unsuccessful. If its container is broken they'll enject and spread throughout the ship
- Meds and Drugs
  - 4 personal medkids, surgical instrumnets, 3 doses of Neversleep Pills, 3 doses of Hydr8tion and 2 doses Naproleve

### Science Lab 1

- Lights flicker and smells of decay. There are gnawed bones in the room
- Fungi on floor
  - Closer look at the floor reveals its covered in fungal nodes. Moving without disturbing them require **MOBILITY**
- Bones
  - Closer look will reveal they're not all human bones
  - This room was the nest of an adult Neomorph [can trigger Hunter and Prey event](#hunter-and-prey) with a Neomorph attack at any time
- Metalic Urn
  - Main lab has an enclossed decontamination area on the examinsation table which contains a Metalic Urn
  - Malfunctioning deep cold freezer with a smashed door contains another 4 urns, broken with black congealing pools with fungal nodes growing on them
  - This is the Engineer black liquid and has fatal results (Virulence 12 disease)
- Fungal Nodes
  - Neomorphic Egg Sacs ready to eject Motes and affect anyone with exposed orifices
- Key Card
  - Half-submerged in Black Liquid is the emergency key card to access MU/TH/UR
  - The Key Card was dropped by Ava during a fight with the Neomorphs

### Science Lab 2

- This toom is burnt out and smells of brunt rubber and plaster
- A body is buried in the debris shrivelled up but clusting it's chest. Closer look ill reveal its not quite human but a Stage IV Abomination. The give away is the length of arms.

### Junction B-2

- Junction works fine and allows access from Decks A-C as well as ventilation and maintenance shafts

## Cronus Deck C

### Junction C-1

- Junction 1 begins at the main airlock and terminates here.
- The external airlock door is sabotaged but the interal door works fine
- Cronus has an external elevator attached to this airlock it's out of order now. It was used to lower crew to the surface of the planet

### Storage Units

- Three units contain ship supplies and tools including the following
- Sterilization Protocol - several drums of unstable napalm. Lighting up one will cause **Blast Power 12** followed by **Fire 12** intensity
- Clayton's secret stash - Requires a code and is full of 24 Engineer Urns
- Tools - Two bolt guns, cutting torch, maintenance jack

### Cargo Bays

- Pitch black even when the power is restored
- Rattling chains can be heard from inside
- Bay 1 - food stores that are untouched
- Bay 2 - empty save for RV tyres

### Catwalk

- Overlooks Vehicle Bay on Deck D
- Only way to get to the Technical section of this desk
- Crane on ceiling tracks loads cargo onto vehicles

### Cargo Office

- Cargo crane opperated from here overlooking into the Vehicle Bay

### Junction C-2

- Relatively safe junction with functioning doors

### Coolant Tanks

- Only accessible via service tunnels
- Keeps the engines from overloading
- If sabotaged the reactor begins building to critical mass and will explode the ship

### Reactor Relay and Control

- Only light is dim pale blue from open access port on the reactor relay casting long and deep shadows
- Something tore up the furniture and equipment to create a bizzare nest here
- The Abomination
  - Middle of the debris near the reactor is a crumpled-up space suit. Helmet is filthy and fogged and the suit scorched
  - Spacesuit is actually a **Passive Stage IV Abomination** . It's been hibernating for decades huddled by the reactor
  - Moving quietly **MOBILITY** can avoid waking the Abomination.
  - Cleaning will wake it up and if they flee it will stalk them on the ship
- Cleaning up
  - Yellow-white (dried Neomorph blood) resin covering most of the room needs to be removed to bring the engines online
  - Cleaning the control room restores the reactor relay
  - But repaires are still needed on the outside of the ship to reconnect the relay to the 4 fission engines **HEAVY MACHINERY** and 3 turns of work
- Radiation Leaks
  - Reactor leaks entire room is covered by strong radiation (1 Rad per Turn p76 CRB)
  - Firing weapons here - any misses roll a Panic Dice. a 1 causes critical damage to the reactor relay and triggers total destruction of the ship after 10 mins
    - Damage can be repaired with **HEAVY MACHINERY** and a turn
- Self-destruct
  - Can cause self-destruct here by shutting off cooling unit leading towards critical mass requires **COMTECH** and a turn of work
  - Reactor begins 10 min countdown to overload. Stopping it requires **COMTECH** and a round of work. After 5 mins it's irresversible.

## Cronus Deck D

### Garage

- Dusty from disuse and settled debris
- Vehicles are missing - only two ATVs are present both lying on their sides
- Deep shadows are everywhere here with many places to hide
- Dispatch Office, Equipment Shed and Parts Storage
  - clear of danager and contain whatever reasonavle tools the PCs might require
- Garage door
  - Opens like a ramp but locks must be removed first
  - Bay can be decompressed before opening while in space otherwise everything will blow out
- Airlocks
  - All 4 airlocks have been sabotaged and cannot work without massive repairs

## Mandatory Events

### Act II Start - DONE

- Having defeated Neomorgh the PCs get chance to catch their breath **Stress Level +1**
- Can start planning their way home... only realise other dangers lurking about
- Survivors are
  - XO Johns (now dead)
  - Sgt. Reid
  - Dr. Cooper (now dead)
  - Dr. Flynn
  - Company Rep Clayton
- Upon waking they suffer amnesia and acute disorientation from a long time in status
- They need **MEDICAL AID** to start recovering perferable in the Medlab if the PCs clean it up
- PCs suits O2 levels will be running really low but the air is breathable but [stale](#cronus)
  - Aboard the Cronus, everyone has trouble breathing
  - Air is stale and heavy in carbon dioxide
  - Johns will tell them after decades of disuse, the air scrubbers probably need to be replaced in the central air scrubber shaft
- Begin [Partial Truths](#partial-truths)

### Partial Truths - DONE

- Survivors need **MEDICAL AID**, perferably in the Medlab if the PCs clean it, up to help with disorientation and amnesia
- Once recovered XO Johns tells PCs that they set down on LV-1113 and explored ancient ruins
  - Company Rep Clayton will quickly interjects that it was an archeological mission
  - Johns will continue that their Science Team collected important artifacts (the ampules in Science Lab) and inadvertently brought back spores with them
  - The spores infected some of the crew with Neomorphic Motes
  - Johns also know the egg sacks (that typically collect on air filters) pose a danger
  - Doctors on the Science Team created a cure that neutralizes the Neomorphic growth that turns it into an inert tumor
  - Everyone was inoculated so Johns is confused why Cooper turned
  - A search of Cooper will reveal his still-full syringe - he never used it
- If any PCs removed their compression suits Dr. Flynn says they need to be inoculated immediately as they're likely infected by Motes
  - One PC can use Dr Cooper's dose and there are other doses in the MedLab they can retrieve
  - However innoculations causes PCs to become [infected](#infected)
- If they go to the MedLab Dr Flynn will want to go to retrieve one of the "artifacts"

### T-Minus 20 Minutes - DONE

- Montero's Mother will come through the PCs comms in a crackle
  - "Displacement Drive malfunction. Cascade failure imminent. Fission reactor overload in T-Minus 20 minutes" **Stress Level +1**
  - Mother will remind PCs every minute until 30 seconds left at which she'll countdown to 0
  - At 0 the Montero will suffer a huge explosion meaning it's total destruction
- There is no way to stop it but PCs can try
  - If they head back to Montero to ask Mother to stop the countdown, she refuses, even if ordered by Wilson
  - **COMTECH** at the Reactor control will confirm that the destruction of the ship cannot be stopped and seemed to be triggered intentionally
    - Truth is Mother triggered it herself, following Special Order 966 to ensure Cronus is brought back to W-Y
- PCs may want to get some Tritium/Helium-3 gas canisters so they make some [money from their work](#no-money)
- PCs should understand to survive they need to be on the Cronus and get as far away from the Montero before it explodes
  - NPCs can tell them that if they don't realise
  - As the Cronus engines are offline, they'll need to set Montero on course away from Cronus
    - As the ships are connected by the Umbilical there's a problem decoupling it
      - Can be done by cutting torch and **HEAVY MACHINARY** or **STRENGTH**
        - If fail, the engines of the Montero can use it's engines to break loose
    - Piloting the Montero - PC must either sacrifice themselves or set the autopilot **PILOTING -2** and use the ancient cargo shuttle Daisey to get back to the Cronus
      - On fail, not enough distance between Cronus and Montero so Cronus suffers explosive decompression in D6 compartments on the Cronus
      - Anyone caught outside the Montero when it explodes roll for Explosion **BLAST POWER 12**
      - If Daisy caught in blast it suffers explosive decompression PCs will need to escape in compression suits and abandon the cargo **STRESS LEVEL +1**

### Aggressive Tendencies - START HERE

- Without warning Cronus survivors start acting irrationally and aggressively - attacking PCs in violent rage
  - Clayton has a role to play in Act III so don't turn them
  - Any attacked PC must make a **Panic Roll**
- They've been infected by their inoculations - derivative of the black liquid called 26 Draconis Strain transforms them into **Stage II Abominations p43**
- First only one NPC turns, attacking in a rage without regard for their own survival or warning
- Once the first attack is over attack with one or two more NPCs - attack or disappear to come back as **Stage III Abomination**
- If bodies examined, they see changes are brought on by the black liquid. Remaining crew will panic. A Scientist can **ANALYZE** the bodies to learn more about the transformation

### Encountering Ava - START HERE

- Any location on the Cronus the PCs will encounter the ship's damaged android Ava
- Unlike the other bodies they encountered where they are ravaged, the body of Ava is whole
- The back of her head is slick and sticky, closer look will reveal its milk-white substance
- She can be **REPAIRED**
- Once repaired, Ava offers the PCs help and information
- Neomorphs and Abominations are confused by Androids they smell "off" to them
- Ava tells PCs the truth about the innoculations if they haven't already figured it out
  - Anyone given the innoculations can turn into an Abomination
  - She will reveal presence of Agent AO-3959x.91-15 aboard. The rare "artefacts" that clayton wants taken back to earth are deadly weapons

### Change of Plans

- Once PCs realise Cronus is only way to get home, they'll need to fix it. Johns or someone else from the Cronus crew will inform them how
  - 1. fix the comms array
    - Requires a Space Walk, four turns of work and **COMTECH**
    - Only one PC rolls but others can help
    - **Stage IV Abomination** is hibernating on the outer hull
  - 2. repair her engines - Cham is working on it
    - Requires cleaning up the [reactor control](#reactor-relay-and-control) room where an **Abomination** hibernates
    - Also requires external repairs via spacewalk, three turns of work and **HEAVY MACHINARY**
      - Good time for [aggressive tendencies](#aggressive-tendencies)
  - 3. get air scrubbers working - DONE
    - See [Air Scrubbers](#air-scrubbers)

### Cham / Lucas

- Cham is secretly Lucas - an Android working for a W-Y competitor
- Cham wants to do his duty, help fellow crewmates and protect them with his life
- Lucas has been sent to investigate the Cronus and to learn more about Xenos
  - Ask crew for logs and anything to learn about them without raising suspicions
- Android nature will be revealed when caused to bleed (but get +3 to health, Strength, Agility)

### Hunter And Prey (Act I, II & III)

- An adult Neomorph hibernating on the Cronus is awakened by the PCs arrival and starts stalking them
- This can occurr at any time

### End of Act II

- With the engines online Mother will lock the Cronus course to Earth under Special Order 966

## Optional Events

### No Money - DONE

- Miller (and Rye) insist on saving part of the valuable Helium-3 gas before the Montero explodes
- Cargo shuttle Daisy can carry 10 tanks each requiring **HEAVY MACHINARY** to load each one
  - On fail, roll 1 Stress Dice. On 1 the tank explodes destroying Daisy and killing everyone present in the Montero cargo bay hold
- Remember to keep counting down when dramatically appropriate
- On a tilt, Daisy can be wedged into the vehicle bay of the Cronus **PILOTING**
  - On fail, roll 1 Stress Dice. On 1 the tanks explodes destroying Daisy and killing everyone present in Daisy

### Infected

- If any PCs took inoculation, some of them will start to [turn into Abominations](#playing-abomination)
- First choose one PC and desribe how their skin starts to itch and their head hurts as they enter **Stage I Abomination** transformation **Stress Level +1** for each infected PC
- Shortly after the PC enters **Stage II Abomination** and is overcome by violent rage. Resist by **Sickness Virulence 6**
  - Give them new "Infected Agenda" card and let them continue controlling them until their initial attack is resolved. **Panic Roll** for other PCs
  - If infected PC survives the first attack they become an NPC for me to control. They start stalking the other PCs and soon turns into **Stage III Abomination** (and later **Stage IV**)
  - Give the PC a new NPC to play

### Egg Sacs Afoot

- The PCs will encounter Neomorphic Egg Sacs
- As long as PC wear their suits they're fine
- A Scientist can use the Analysis talent on the sacs to learn more
- Infection causes a **Virulence 9** roll (can chose if I want them infected or not), a fail enters **Neomorph Stage III** within one shift

### Sensor Ghost Redux (Act I & II)

- If PCs repair sensor station on bridge it emits occational pings to alert of a nearby ship that doesn't appear to exist
- The ping is from the Sotillo but PCs can't learn that yet

### Playing Abomination

- If a PC is infected, they struggle to maintain their sanity while dealing with excruciating pain
- PC can fight the transformation to make it to **Stage II Abomination** before the rage takes over them
- They then rely on instinct, although can be confused by something that was important to them in the past
  - e.g. might find his way back to their ship / quarters
- As **Stage II Abomination** they are no longer human, no longer in control. Chose a new PC
