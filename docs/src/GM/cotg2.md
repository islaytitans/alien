# Chariot of the Gods 2

## Party

## Session Open

- Read what's the story mother
- Remind roll are less often than d&d only when failure has significant impact
- Give agenda cards
  - Decide who is 'Lucas' and give their agenda card instead of the Normal Agenda Card with the 'Note to Lucas'
  - Give Wilson Special order 966 too
- [Start on Montero](#openning)

## Locations

## Montero

> Map p7

> Gear p6

- Same class as the Nostromo but untable to tow cargo due to smaller engines. Instead it's hauled internally

### Cargo

- Contains 72 high pressure tanks containing 200,000 tones of aging but still flammable and volatile Tritium
  - Once Montero reaches destination it will be harmless Helium-3
- Montero has an ailing WY-37B 34 meter Flatbed cargo loader called Daisy to move the cargo

### Passageway Umbilical

- 10 meter passage to connect airlocks with another spacecraft

## Cronus

- Space exploration vehicle launched in 22nd centry similiar to Prometheus
- Consists of 4 decks accessible through main junction ladderways, two large elevators, and a collapsed staircase
- Contains a separate science lab module that can be jettisoned in an emergency. The module is missing at the start of the adventure
- All escape pods are missing
- All vehicles are missing except for 2 ATVs
- Environment
  - Cold : When PCs arrive interior is a deep freeze. If PCs open their suits before life support system they will become **FREEZING** and need to make **STAMINA** rolls against the cold once per turn
  - Dark : Until MU/TH/UR 2000 comes online the interior is lit only by weak emergency light (all zones count as dark)
  - Air : Until MU/TH/UR online, air scrubbers powered and cleaned the air is stale and high concentration of carbon dioxide. All **STAMINA** -2 until fixed.
  - Gravity : Artificial gravity still works
  - Decompression : Outer hull has Armor Rating 6. Shots that miss target in an area with an exterior wall will cause explosive decompression (p73 CRB). Doors and vents to compartment are auto-closed and permanetly sealed after one round
- Doors
  - All doors can be opened at a push of a button unless otherwise stated
  - Some doors can only be opened by MU/TH/UR or by using an encrypted key card carried by Wilson and Clayton. Can also be found in Science Lab 1, dropped by Ava

## Cronus Cryo Deck A

### Main Airlock, Junction A-1

- Only entry point into the Cronus
- When viewed from outside the outer airlock door is damaged as if buckled from inside
- Opening it requires a torch and **HEAVY MACHINERY** once open can't close it
- Once breached need Montero's passsageway umbilical to the Cronus to pressurize before opening inside airlock door.
  - If damaged explosive decompression happens
- Airlock junction leads down to Deck B and Deck C its covered in scuff and scratch marks

### MU/TH/UR 2000 Mainframe

- Protected area requires entering a command sequence or the emergency access key
  - Things only Wilson, Johns and Cooper have at the beginning of the scenario
- Clean, blinking server room with one terminal which highest-ranking member of a crew can use to talk to MU/TH/UR

### Air Scrubbers

- Currently offline when the PCs arrive. It's dark and water is frozen
- Only accessible via ventilation and maintenance shafts
- When operational it cleans the air and generate oxygen via electrolysis
- Powered directly by direct feed from reactors, the shaft ends in water filled chamber on Deck C. Condensation forms here and rains down here
- Once MU/TH/UR goes online and power is restored the scrubbers become active and ice melts
  - It is very noisy **Observation -2** here
  - Risk of electrocution in here - failed skill roll results in immediate attack rolled with **six Base Dice and Damage 1**
- **Heavy Machinary** and shift worth of work to clean the carbon filters from grime/mold to bring oxygen level to normal
  - If PCs actively examine filters they will see Neomorphic Egg Scacs p39 growing on them.
  - If distrubed the Neomorphic Motes are released throughout the ship
  - Only way to remove eggs sacs is to burn them. Ava 6 can explain

### Elevators

- Provide access to vehicle bay
- Elevator 1 functions fine once power is restored although contains bulletholes and dried blood
- Elevator 2 shaft doors are open and the elevator is crumpled on the vehicle bay level. Looks like someone threw incendiary grenades

### Cryo chambers

- Main door into this area has claw marks as if something was trying to get in
- Door is locked from the inside requiring **Heavy Machinery** to open
- Cryobeds are covered in frost, most are empty, two broken ones contain husks of bodies but inside some are the sleeping surviving crew of the Cronus
- Once life support is online the crew wakes up p28
- Lockers here contain personal gear of the Cronus

### Examination Room

- Room is a mess but contains two **Medkits**

### Showers

- Showers are filthy and some Neomorphic egg sacs are growing on the drains

### Junction A-2

- Shaft leads to other levels of the ship

### Eva Storage 1 & 2

- Three remaining spacesuits are here - older models of the IRC Mk.50 Compression Suit
- They have not been tampered with and function fine

## Cronus Main Deck B

### Armory

- Mostly stripped bare with a splatter of dried milky-white spray on the wall from Ava's encounter she had with an Abomination
- 1 x M41A Pulse Rifle but **heavy**
- 1 x shotguns shell case

### Junction B-1

- Ladder is undamaged and all doors work

### Vestibules

- Next to Junction B-1 are two bays for escape bods which are both missing
- Bulky red EVA ECO All-Worlds Survival Suits (p92 CRB) suits can be mistaken as a stalker if the lights are still off

### Bridge

- Until power is restored the bridge is on battery and is shutdown with a low standby lights glow
- Blast shutters are still lowered and locked over the viewports
- There is soot on the ceiling and serveral stations are burned out
- Command Station
  - Once power is restored Command Station will be functional
  - Captain's Station has a small panel that contains MU/TH/UR emergency access key but the glass is broken and the key is missing
  - Captain's Station hold "at a glance" info on the consoles
  - If PCs access the command station and make **COM-TECH** roll they'll find out where the Cronus has been; on a distant, uncharted planet in the 26 Draconis system
- Holographic Display Table
  - Slagged and brunt out hologram tech beyond repair
- Sensor station
  - Damaged by the fire but can be repaired with a **COM-TECH** and Shift of work
  - Damaged senors sporadically pick up [sensor ghost](#sensor-ghost-redux)
- Life Support Monitors
  - When power is restored the monitors will flash red due to the high carbon dioxide levels
  - It says maintenance must be performed on the air scrubbers either [replaced](#bad-air)
  - If PCs talk to MU/TH/UR before restoring power to this terminal she shares the same info
- Pilot Station
  - An axe is embedded in Station 1 and Station 2 is dead regardless if the power is restored
  - It is possible to open up the deck plating and try to reconnect power **HEAVY MACHINERY** for one Shift of work
  - Faster, easier solution would be to cannibalize Station 2 to repair sation 1 **COM-TECH +2** for one shift of work
  - Only one pilot station is needed to fly the ship

### Crew Quarters

- All rooms are locked tight, ranascked, or smell like death
- Small personal items of worth can be found here but the crew of the Cronus won't be happy if taken

### Mess Hall

- Food stores are ravaged and most of the exposed food stores are rotten
- Someone had been making origami anmals out of metallic paper and setting them up around the room
- These animals are made by Ava in her deranged state

### Corporate Suite

- Clayton's wardroom and quarters is spacious and was luxurious but now a ruin with blood on the bed, sofa storn apart and furniture is destroyed
- Drugs
  - Under the mattress is a pack of illegal stimulants to be injected into the ocular cavity. Reduces **STRESS LEVEL** to 0. D6 doses
- Wall Safe
  - Only accessible via Clayton's code containing
    - encrypted Modular Computing Device cube storing all data on the science mission to LV-1113
    - 1 million dollars in cash
  - Without code the safe can be cracked **COM-TECH -3** and 1 shift of work
  - The door can be blown open with an explosion with **BLAST POWER 12** which damages the cube and destorys most of the cash
- Wetbar
  - Bar is cleaved in two and most bottles are destroyed
- Closet / Escape Pod
  - Anyone examining the closet realises that it also functions as an EEV - escape pod
  - Escape Pod is functional but can only be accessed with Clayton's code
  - Escape Pod has three cryo-pods but not FTL capable

### Med Lab

- MedPod
  - Two Pauling Medpods (p100 CRB) and specimen jars containing floating Bloodbursters (p40)
  - One is shattered as if something broke out of it
    - Works **MEDICAL AID + 3** but risks sepsis (roll **Virulence 6** p75 CRB)
  - One is sealed and lit from within but the entire surface is covered in thick dried blood
    - Can be opened and it contains a Stage IV Abomination that was vivisectioned with is sckull and chest cavity open. Getting too close it'll have one last gasp and attack the PC but killed easily (3 Health no Armor)
  - They were included on this mission specifically for removing parasite organisms
- Another jar without liquid contains fungal nodes (Neomorphic Egg Sacs)
- Metalic Urn
  - Next to that jar is an open metalic urn containing 4 organic-looking vials. 3 are intact containing black liquid, the 4th is broken and empty
  - The vials need to be kept in cold storage. If it starts to sweat it'll release the black liquid and will affect the PCs
- The Cure
  - Under desk is a medikit containing 6 syringes full of 26 Draconis Strain derivative - a cure of being infected with Meomorphic Motes
- Bloodbursters
  - Two Bloodbursters in the jars are dead. They were surgically removed from their victims by the Medpods but killing both the infected and the Neomorph
- Motes
  - If Egg Sacs disturbed motes will eject and try to find a host but dying if unsuccessful. If its container is broken they'll enject and spread throughout the ship
- Meds and Drugs
  - 4 personal medkids, surgical instrumnets, 3 doses of Neversleep Pills, 3 doses of Hydr8tion and 2 doses Naproleve

### Science Lab 1

- Lights flicker abd smells of decay. There are gnawed bones in the room. \
- Closer look at the floor reveals its covered in fungal nodes. Moving without disturbing them require **MOBILITY**
- Metalic Urn
  - Main lab has an enclossed decontamination area on the examinsation table which contains a Metalic Urn
  - Malfunctioning deep cold freezer with a smashed door contains another 4 urns, broken with black congealing pools with fungal nodes growing on them
  - This is the Engineer black liquid and has fata results (Virulence 12 disease)
- Bones
  - Closer look will reveal they're not all human bones
  - This room was the nest of an adult Neomorph [can trigger Hunter and Prey event](#hunter-and-prey) with a Neomorph attack at any time
- Fungal Nodes
  - Neomorphic Egg Sacs ready to eject Motes and affect anyone with exposed orifices
- Key Card
  - Half-submerged in Black Liquid is the emergency key card to access MU/TH/UR
  - The Key Card was dropped by Ava during a fight with the Neomorphs

### Science Lab 2

- This toom is burnt out and smells of brunt rubber and plaster
- A body is buried in the debris shrivelled up but clusting it's chest. Closer look ill reveal its not quite human but a Stage IV Abomination. The give away is the length of arms.

### Junction B-2

- Junction works fine and allows access from Decks A-C as well as ventilation and maintenance shafts

## Cronus Deck C

### Junction C-1

- Junction 1 begins at the main airlock and terminates here.
- The external airlock door is sabotaged but the interal door works fine
- Cronus has an external elevator attached to this airlock it's out of door now. It was used to lower crew to the surface of the planet

### Storage Units

- Three units contain ship supplies and tools including the following
- Sterilization Protocol - several drums of unstable napalm. Lighting up one will cause **Blast Power 12** followed by **Fire 12** intensity
- Clayton's secret stash - Requires a code and is full of 24 Engineer Urns
- Tools - Two bolt guns, cutting torch, maintenance jack

### Cargo Bays

- Pitch black even when the power is restored
- Rattling chains can be heard from inside
- Bay 1 - food stores that are untouched
- Bay 2 - empty save for RV tires

### Catwalk

- Overlooks Vehicle Bay on Deck D
- Only way to get to the Technical section of this desk
- Crane on ceiling tracks loads cargo onto vehicles

### Cargo Office

- Cargo crane opperated from here overlooking into the Vehicle Bay

### Junction C-2

- Relativelt safe junction with functioning doors

### Coolant Tanks

- Only accessible via service tunnels
- Keeps the engines from overloading
- If sabotaged the reactor begins building to critical mass and will explode the ship

### Reactor Relay and Control

- Only light is dim pale blue from open access port on the reactor relay casting long and deep shadows
- Something tore up the furniture and equipment to create a bizzare nest here
- The Abomination
  - Middle of the debris near the reactor is a crumpled-up space suit. Helmet is filthy and fogged and the suit looks like it was set on fire at one point
  - Spacesuit is actually a **Passive Stage IV Abomination** and its helmet is actually its bulbous head. It's been hibernating for decades huddled by the reactor
  - Moving quietly **MOBILITY** can avoid waking the Abomination.
  - Cleaning will wake it up and if they flee it will stalk them on the ship
- Cleaning up
  - Yellow-white (dried Neomorph blood) resin covering most of the room that needs to be removed to bring the engines online
  - Cleaning the control room restores the reactor relay repaires are still needed on the outside of the ship to reconnect the relay to the 4 fission engines **HEAVY MACHINERY** and 3 turns of work
- Radiation Leaks
  - Reactor leaks entire room is covered by strong radiation (1 Rad per Turn p76 CRB)
  - Firing weapons here - any missies roll a PAnic Dice one a 1 causes critical damage to the reactor relay and triggers total destruction of the ship after 10 mins. Damage can be repaired with **HEAVY MACHINERY** and a turn
- Self-destruct
  - Can cause self-destruct here by shutting off cooling unit leading towards critical mass requires **COMTECH** and a turn of work
  - Reactor begins 10 min countdown to overload. Stopping it requires **COMTECH** and a round of work. After 5 mins it's irresversible.

## Cronus Deck D

### Garage

- Dusty from disuse and settled debris
- Vehicles are missing - only two ATVs are present both lying on their sides
- Deep shadows are everywhere here with many places to hide
- Dispatch Office, Equipment Shed and Parts Storage
  - clear of danager and contain whatever reasonavle tools the PCs might require
- Garage door
  - Opens like a ramp but locks must be removed first
  - Bay can be decompressed before opening while in space otherwise everything will blow out
- Airlocks
  - All 4 airlocks have been sabotaged and cannot work without massive repairs

## Mandatory Events

### Act II Start

- Having defeated Neomorgh the PCs get chance to catch their breath **Stress Level +1**
- Can start planning their way home... only realise other dangers lurking about
- Survivors are
  - XO Johns
  - Sgt. Reid
  - Dr. Cooper (now dead)
  - Dr. Flynn
  - Company Rep Clayton
- Upon waking they suffer amnesia and acute disorientation from a long time in status
- They need **MEDICAL AID** to start recovering perferable in the Medlab if the PCs clean it up
- PCs suits O2 levels will be running really low but the air is breathable
  - Aboard the Cronus, everyone has trouble breathing
  - Air is stale and heavy in carbon dioxide
  - Johns will tell them after decades of disuse, the air scrubbers probably need to be replaced in the central air scrubber shaft
- Begin [Partial Truths](#partial-truths)

### Partial Truths

- Survivors need **MEDICAL AID** to start recovering perferable in the Medlab if the PCs clean it up to help with disorientation and amnesia
- Once recovered XO Johns tells PCs that they set down on LV-1113 and explored ancient ruins
  - Company Rep Clayton will quickly interjects that it was an archeological mission
  - Johns will continue that their Science Team collected important artifacts (the ampules in Science Lab) and inadvertently brought back spores with them
  - The spores infected some of the crewwith Neomorphic Motes
  - Johns also know the egg sacks (that typically collect on air filters) pose a danger
  - Doctors on the Science Team created a cure that neutralizes the Neomorphic growth that turns it into an inert tumor
  - Everyone was inoculated so Johns is confused
  - A search of Cooper will reveal his still-full syringe - he never used it
- If any PCs removed their compression suits Dr. Flynn says they need to be inoculated immediately as they're likely infected by Motes
- One PC can use Dr Cooper's dose and there are other doses in the MedLab they can retrieve
- If they go to the MedLab Dr Flynn will want to go to retrieve one of the "artifacts"

### T-Minus 10 Minutes

- Montero's Mother will come through the PCs comms in a crackle
  - "Displacement Drive malfunction. Cascade failure imminent. Fission reactor overload in T-Minus 10 minutes" **Stress Level +1**
  - Mother will remind PCs every minute until 30 seconds left at which she'll countdown to 0
- There is no way to stop itbut PCs can try
- At 0 the Montero will suffer a huge explosion meaning it's total destruction
- If they head back to Montero to ask Mother to stop the countdown, she refuses, even if ordered by Wilson
- **COMTECH** at the Reactor control will confirm that the destruction of the ship cannot be stopped and seemed to be triggered intentionally
  - Truth is Mother triggered it herself, following Special Order 966 to ensure Cronus is brought back to W-Y
- PCs should understand to survive they need to be on the Cronus and get as far away from the Montero before it explodes
  - NPCs can tell them that if they don't realise
- As the Cronus engines are offline, they'll need to set Montero on course away from Cronus
- PC must either sacrifice themselves or the pilot can set the Montero on autopilot **PILOTING -2** and use the ancient cargo shuttle Daisey to get back to the Cronus
  - On fail, not enough distance between Cronus and Montero so Cronus suffers explosive decompression in D6 compartments on the Cronus

### Change of Plans

### Aggressive Tendencies

## Optional Events

### Breaking Loose

### No Money

### Encountering Ava

### Infected

### You Can't Handle the Truth

### Egg Sacs Afoot

- The PCs will encounter Neomorphic Egg Sacs
- As long as PC wear their suits they're fine
- A Scientist can use the Analysis talent on the sacs to learn more
- Infection causes a **Virulence 9** roll (can chose if I want them infected or not), a fail enters Stage III within one shift

### Hunter And Prey (Act I, II & III)

- An adult Neomorph hibernating on the Cronus is awakened by the PCs arrival and starts stalking them
- This can occurr at any time

### Sensor Ghost Redux (Act I & II)

- If PCs repair sensor station on bridge it emits occational pings to alert of a nearby ship that doesn't appear to exist
- The ping is from the Sotillo but PCs can't learn that yet

### Getting out of Dodge

- If PCs want to leave the Cronus MU/TH/UR of the Montero triggers self-descruct Special Order 966 from W-Y see [T-Minus Ten Minutes](#t-minus-10-minutes)
