- A 'gravity sheer', like one that pulled Cetorhina into the station, has occurred
- PCs will feel the G-forces hitting them momentarily as Erebos' automatically engages its thrusters to maintain safe orbit arounf the black hole
- A NPC will comment "When the black hole acts up like that the thrusters kick in, fed by the plasma tanks its the only thing keeping the station from falling into the black hole"

### Mr Man's Escape Artists

- Led by Tommy Man, **6 ACTIVE Conscripte Convicts** storm the Cetorhina in attempt to flee
- If they take control, they gun the thrusters, break the ship free but tear a hole in both hulls causing explosive decompression, the same will happens if the PCs try to rush their escape
  - Read "Escape" p57

### The Ninth Passenger

- Cetorhina has a stowaway - a **Protomorph Deacon**
  - It will hunt the PCs
  - It will make its nest at the top of the two-story tall FTL engine amoungst the Living Proto-Hive tendrils that are growing through the deckplates to connect with it
- If Cetorhina escapes without realising the Living Hive is growing onboard the ship it will bring death to civilized worlds
  - This Hive is young it can be killed with **Intensity 9** fire

### The Blip

- Can trigger the [Finale](#act-3-finale)
- First proximity alarm alerts the Pcs to a large mass in a slightly different orbital trajectory
- Second time it goes off it identifies Asteroid 1113B
  - MURTHER / DAUTUR will confirm that if the station orbit hasn't changed the asteroid will pulverise Erebos within 2 hours
  - Depending on goals PCs may want to course correct or sabotage its ability to course correct
    - This can be done at Control on Deck B or Boiler Room on Deck J via **COMTECT** and **HEAVY MACHINERY** or wrecking the place.
  - If asteroids does it, its a glancing blow. The station is severely damaged but not destroyed sending it spinning towards the blackhole giving PCs another change to escape

### The Rescue

- "Weyland" rescue ship moves in close to scan the station revealing itself to be the UPP Destroyer Snova Traknu
- It's here to retrieve its operatives and destroy Erebos
- UPP may be persauded to take the PCs with them
- Play this event in tandem with [Survivor](#survivor), [Escalation](#escalation) and/or [Retaliation](#retaliation) and have the Destroyer crushed by the living station

### Survivor

- Can be played with [The Rescue](#the-rescue)
  - Dropship craw is a Sace Operating Forces commando team from the UPP Destroyer Snova Traknu
- A gray Cheyenne dropship (UPP Accipiter) docks at a port neat the PCs
- They are immediately besiged by **3 ACTIVE PROTOMORPH TRILOBITES** p66
  - Only one ends up surviving - Sub-Lieutenant C'ng Pfluger

### Escalation

- When the Snova Traknu has moved close to the station Erebos trwaling arms bend and reach for the Destroyer, embracing and crushing it
- If Erebos no longer has the Cetorhina's FTL drive, it tries to take the Snova's

### Retaliation

- Can trigger the [Finale](#act-3-finale)
- Snova Trakhnu fires nukes at Erebos from point blank range destroying itself in an attempt to take out the station as well
- While Cellblock on Deck F, Boom and Starboard side of Deck H are destroyed, Erebos's plasma collectors draw most of the energy temporarily supercharging the station
- All lights brun bright and burn out, blinding everyone for one round and forcing all Protomorphs to go into hiding
- The force of the blast sends the station hurting towards the black hole see Act 3 finale

### The Help

- Perfect Aly, Great-Aunt Lugar, decides to help PCs, warning them that the Perfected are going to use FTL to leave the system
- Aly won't actively defy the Perfected but will provide hints and attempt to stall attacks against the Perfected
- Aly can provide any info the PCs are missing

### The Death Throes

- Event played if Erebos is infected with the weaponized virus or poisoned by toxic gas from the Wastebin on Deck H
- Virus swarms through the Proto-Hive pustulous globules swell and weep acid blood hissing and eroding everything
- Every now and again a globule bursts spraying **10 Acid Splash** causing damage or making passage harder

## Act 3 Finale

- Finale should be concurrent with the last 2 events planned for the PCs before Fulfremmen threat is resolved
- Erebos is going down the Ablassen Drain Black hole
- Actions or circumstances of the events is causing Erebos to fall into the blackhole
  - Hit by Asteroid by [the Blip](#the-blip)
  - Pushed out of orbit by [the Realiation](#retaliation)
  - Or by fires on Deck H
  - Living-Hive is in its death throes due to the PC's use of virus, poison, impact, or fires and will try to take the PCs into the black hole with it
  - PCs decide to push the station into the black hole
- The station's hull will buckle **+1 Stress Level**

### Beat the Clock

- Station's remaining time is up to me, point of no return should be reached at dramatically appropriate moment
- Maybe use a Clock

### All Bets Off

- Once station is doomed the Fulfremmen have had enough
- PCs have ruined their plans somehow so a lone **ACTIVE PERFECTED** is tasked with killing the PCs
  - The Relentless Perfected (p70) is wounded (7 health remaining) with a jagged piece of metal protruding from its abdomen

### Last Grasp

- Thrusters have been firing to stabilize the station
- Signpost the PCs a chance to realize they can alter their trajectory
- If PCs manage to neutralize the threat of Fulfremmen before the crash they may want to save the station

### Plotting The Escape

- A Terminal or MUTHUR or DAUTUR can be used to calculate the trajectory to escape and to dump all stations stored energy into thrusters
- **COMTECH** or **HEAVY MACHINERY** in the Boiler Room on Deck J will unlock the plasma values so the thrusters can fire full power, then a **PILOTING -3** required from Control Deck B
  - If failed they can be told that they need to jettison some weight via override codes, or fire Cetorhina's thrusters at the right time and try again reducing the difficulty for each measure taken
    - PCs may have override codes left on a note in the Engineer's Office on Deck D or get the info out of Stykes
    - Codes entered into any terminal allow portions of the station to be jetisoned
    - Astrometric Observatory (Deck A)
    - Comms Tower (Deck H)
    - Living-Hive filled Lifeboats

### The Long Goodbye

- If [Plotting The Escape](#plotting-the-escape) failed or the PCs want the station destroyed Erebos is now offically doomed
- In 2 Turns, the station's Control Tower Crumples
- In 4 Turns, the station's tawling arms begin being stretched and pulled intowards the centre
- In 6 Turns, the station's hub cracks, igniting the lower tower's plasma supplies in a masssive explosion that wipsps away down the Ablassen Drain

### Escape at a cost

- Lifeboats are located on Deck I but are packed with Living Proto-Hive Nodules (p63) and bodies incubating new **Proto-Xenomorph Decons**
- PCs can attempt to escape the station in one of these lifeboats but risk spreading the Perfected to the colonies
- An Incinerator can be used to kill the Proto-Hive but it will damage the life support and need to wear compression suits as a result
- Possible rupture the deck's Thermal Plasma Sinks right before launching **Heavy Machinery** to close the hatch in time
- **Piloting -2** to capapult into a stable orbit around the blackhole

### Signing off p61

## Optional Events

### The Perfect Demand

- Shrill noise and imagery explodes inside the Pcs heads
- A Perfected and **2 Deacons** have cornered the PCs again
- They are overwhelmed with the Perfected's doubt - they question why the PCs have not delivered them the 26 Draconis Strain, leaving them with a warning to fulfill their obligations
- The **Deacons** then stalk the PCs from afar
- If the PCs deliver the Strain to the Perfected their heads are filled with an overwhelming sense of relief, gratitude and victory
  - They are given the best reward they can conceive 0 strip and bathe in Hessdalen Lights (any radiation zone) to become one with the perfect living hive

### A Room with a View

- Several rooms have been converted by the hive into Protomorph birthing chambers
- Dank, humid and smelling of rotting flesh
- Contains **3 Passive fleshy Utero-pods** p65 cling to the ceiling each containing an unripe Squid-Baby
- Pod will burst and the baby is slow to react with initiative 10

### Quartermaster

- This works best when there is an NPC the PCs have met but not seen recently e.g. the Warden Stykes
- Sounds of struggle ahead - 5 members of the Erebos Station crew / constripts
- Unfortunately these people have been transformed
- **4 Passive Mutant Abominations** are attempting to draw and quarter a 5th
  - They tear him apart each taking a limb and sitting down to eat

### Watch the World Burn

  - Replacement energy cells 1m tall barrels with harness Straps **Weight 3** can be found in Terminal 01 and the Lower Tower
  - The Pcs can repair them **Heavy Machinery** and fire up the plasma distillery on Trawling Arm 01 to recharge them p40, p44, p41
  - Ship will need 3 cells for engine ignition and take **1 Turn** to reisntall cell on the ship
- Truster Compression Coil
  - Thrusters won't work without it

    - near the Visitor Docking Port on Deck D p34
    - the comms Tower on Deck H p44
    - Boiler room on Dec j p46
  - Takes **1 Turn** to remove or install compression coil
- Cutting Tools
