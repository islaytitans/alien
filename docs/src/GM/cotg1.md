  - Decide who is 'Lucas' and give their agenda card instead with the 'Note to Lucas'
  - Give Wilson Special order 966 too
- Start on Montero

## Scenes

### Montero

> Map p7
> Gear p6

- Same class as the Nostromo but untable to tow cargo due to smaller engines. Instead it's hauled internally

#### Cargo

- Contains 72 high pressure tanks containing 200,000 tones of aging but still flammable and volatile Tritium
  - Once Montero reaches destination it will be harmless Helium-3
- Montero has an ailing WY-37B 34 meter Flatbed cargo loader called Daisy to move the cargo

#### Passageway Umbilical

- 10 meter passage to connect airlocks with another spacecraft

### Cronus

- Space exploration vehicle launched in 22nd centry similiar to Prometheus
- Consists of 4 decks accessible through main junction ladderways, two large elevators, and a collapsed staircase
- Contains a separate science lab module that can be jettisoned in an emergency. The module is missing at the start of the adventure
- All escape pods are missing
- All vehicles are missing except for 2 ATVs
- Cold : When PCs arrive interior is a deep freeze. If PCs open their suits before life support system they will become **FREEZING** and need to make **STAMINA** rolls against the cold once per turn
- Dark : Until MU/TH/UR 2000 comes online the interior is lit only by weak emergency light (all zones count as dark)
- Air : Until MU/TH/UR online, air scrubbers powered and cleaned the air is stale and high concentration of carbon dioxide. All **STAMINA** -2 until fixed.
- Gravity : Artificial gravity still works

### Cronus Cryo Deck A

#### Main Airlock, Junction A-1

- Only entry point into the Cronus
- When viewed from outside the outer airlock door is damaged as if buckled from inside
- Opening it requires a torch and **HEAVY MACHINERY** once open can't close it
- Once breached need Montero's passsageway umbilical to the Cronus to pressurize before opening inside airlock door.
  - If damaged explosive decompression happens
- Airlock junction leads down to Deck B and Deck C its covered in scuff and scratch marks

#### MU/TH/UR 2000 Mainframe

- Protected area requires entering a command sequence or the emergency access key
  - Things only Wilson, Johns and Cooper have at the beginning of the scenario
- Clean, blinking server room with one terminal which highest-ranking member of a crew can use to talk to MU/TH/UR

#### Air Scrubbers

- Currently offline when the PCs arrive. It's dark and water is frozen
- Only accessible via ventilation and maintenance shafts
- When operational it cleans the air and generate oxygen via electrolysis
- Powered directly by direct feed from reactors, the shaft ends in water filled chamber on Deck C. Condensation forms here and rains down here
- Once MU/TH/UR goes online and power is restored the scrubbers become active and ice melts
  - It is very noisy **Observation -2** here
  - Risk of electrocution in here - failed skill roll results in immediate attack rolled with **six Base Dice and Damage 1**
- **Heavy Machinary** and shift worth of work to clean the carbon filters from grime/mold to bring oxygen level to normal
  - If PCs actively examine filters they will see Neomorphic Egg Scacs p39 growing on them.
  - If distrubed the Neomorphic Motes are released throughout the ship
  - Only way to remove eggs sacs is to burn them. Ava 6 can explain

#### Elevators

- Provide access to vehicle bay
- Elevator 1 functions fine once power is restored although contains bulletholes and dried blood
- Elevator 2 shaft doors are open and the elevator is crumpled on the vehicle bay level. Looks like someone threw incendiary grenades

#### Cryo chambers

- Main door into this area has claw marks as if something was trying to get in
- Door is locked from the inside requiring **Heavy Machinery** to open
- Cryobeds are covered in frost, most are empty, two broken ones contain husks of bodies but inside some are the sleeping surviving crew of the Cronus
- Once life support is online the crew wakes up p28
- Lockers here contain personal gear of the Cronus

#### Examination Room

- Room is a mess but contains two **Medkits**

#### Showers

- Showers are filthy and some Neomorphic egg sacs are growing on the drains

#### Junction A-2

- Shaft leads to other levels of the ship

#### Eva Storage 1 & 2

- Three remaining spacesuits are here - older models of the IRC Mk.50 Compression Suit
- They have not been tampered with and function fine
