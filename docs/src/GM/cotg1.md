# Chariot of the Gods 1

## Party

## Session Open

- Read what's the story mother
- Remind roll are less often than d&d only when failure has significant impact
- Give agenda cards
  - Decide who is 'Lucas' and give their agenda card instead with the 'Note to Lucas'
  - Give Wilson Special order 966 too
- Start on Montero

## Scenes

### Montero

> Map p7

> Gear p6

- Same class as the Nostromo but untable to tow cargo due to smaller engines. Instead it's hauled internally

#### Cargo

- Contains 72 high pressure tanks containing 200,000 tones of aging but still flammable and volatile Tritium
  - Once Montero reaches destination it will be harmless Helium-3
- Montero has an ailing WY-37B 34 meter Flatbed cargo loader called Daisy to move the cargo

#### Passageway Umbilical

- 10 meter passage to connect airlocks with another spacecraft

### Cronus

- Space exploration vehicle launched in 22nd centry similiar to Prometheus
- Consists of 4 decks accessible through main junction ladderways, two large elevators, and a collapsed staircase
- Contains a separate science lab module that can be jettisoned in an emergency. The module is missing at the start of the adventure
- All escape pods are missing
- All vehicles are missing except for 2 ATVs
- Environment
  - Cold : When PCs arrive interior is a deep freeze. If PCs open their suits before life support system they will become **FREEZING** and need to make **STAMINA** rolls against the cold once per turn
  - Dark : Until MU/TH/UR 2000 comes online the interior is lit only by weak emergency light (all zones count as dark)
  - Air : Until MU/TH/UR online, air scrubbers powered and cleaned the air is stale and high concentration of carbon dioxide. All **STAMINA** -2 until fixed.
  - Gravity : Artificial gravity still works
  - Decompression : Outer hull has Armor Rating 6. Shots that miss target in an area with an exterior wall will cause explosive decompression (p73 CRB). Doors and vents to compartment are auto-closed and permanetly sealed after one round
- Doors
  - All doors can be opened at a push of a button unless otherwise stated
  - Some doors can only be opened by MU/TH/UR or by using an encrypted key card carried by Wilson and Clayton. Can also be found in Science Lab 1, dropped by Ava

### Cronus Cryo Deck A

#### Main Airlock, Junction A-1

- Only entry point into the Cronus
- When viewed from outside the outer airlock door is damaged as if buckled from inside
- Opening it requires a torch and **HEAVY MACHINERY** once open can't close it
- Once breached need Montero's passsageway umbilical to the Cronus to pressurize before opening inside airlock door.
  - If damaged explosive decompression happens
- Airlock junction leads down to Deck B and Deck C its covered in scuff and scratch marks

#### MU/TH/UR 2000 Mainframe

- Protected area requires entering a command sequence or the emergency access key
  - Things only Wilson, Johns and Cooper have at the beginning of the scenario
- Clean, blinking server room with one terminal which highest-ranking member of a crew can use to talk to MU/TH/UR

#### Air Scrubbers

- Currently offline when the PCs arrive. It's dark and water is frozen
- Only accessible via ventilation and maintenance shafts
- When operational it cleans the air and generate oxygen via electrolysis
- Powered directly by direct feed from reactors, the shaft ends in water filled chamber on Deck C. Condensation forms here and rains down here
- Once MU/TH/UR goes online and power is restored the scrubbers become active and ice melts
  - It is very noisy **Observation -2** here
  - Risk of electrocution in here - failed skill roll results in immediate attack rolled with **six Base Dice and Damage 1**
- **Heavy Machinary** and shift worth of work to clean the carbon filters from grime/mold to bring oxygen level to normal
  - If PCs actively examine filters they will see Neomorphic Egg Scacs p39 growing on them.
  - If distrubed the Neomorphic Motes are released throughout the ship
  - Only way to remove eggs sacs is to burn them. Ava 6 can explain

#### Elevators

- Provide access to vehicle bay
- Elevator 1 functions fine once power is restored although contains bulletholes and dried blood
- Elevator 2 shaft doors are open and the elevator is crumpled on the vehicle bay level. Looks like someone threw incendiary grenades

#### Cryo chambers

- Main door into this area has claw marks as if something was trying to get in
- Door is locked from the inside requiring **Heavy Machinery** to open
- Cryobeds are covered in frost, most are empty, two broken ones contain husks of bodies but inside some are the sleeping surviving crew of the Cronus
- Once life support is online the crew wakes up p28
- Lockers here contain personal gear of the Cronus

#### Examination Room

- Room is a mess but contains two **Medkits**

#### Showers

- Showers are filthy and some Neomorphic egg sacs are growing on the drains

#### Junction A-2

- Shaft leads to other levels of the ship

#### Eva Storage 1 & 2

- Three remaining spacesuits are here - older models of the IRC Mk.50 Compression Suit
- They have not been tampered with and function fine

### Cronus Main Deck B

#### Armory

- Mostly stripped bare with a splatter of dried milky-white spray on the wall from Ava's encounter she had with an Abomination
- 1 x M41A Pulse Rifle but **heavy**
- 1 x shotguns shell case

#### Junction B-1

- Ladder is undamaged and all doors work

#### Vestibules

- Next to Junction B-1 are two bays for escape bods which are both missing
- Bulky red EVA ECO All-Worlds Survival Suits (p92 CRB) suits can be mistaken as a stalker if the lights are still off

#### Bridge

- Until power is restored the bridge is on battery and is shutdown with a low standby lights glow
- Blast shutters are still lowered and locked over the viewports
- There is soot on the ceiling and serveral stations are burned out
- Command Station
  - Once power is restored Command Station will be functional
  - Captain's Station has a small panel that contains MU/TH/UR emergency access key but the glass is broken and the key is missing
  - Captain's Station hold "at a glance" info on the consoles
  - If PCs access the command station and make **COM-TECH** roll they'll find out where the Cronus has been; on a distant, uncharted planet in the 26 Draconis system
- Holographic Display Table
  - Slagged and brunt out hologram tech beyond repair
- Sensor station
  - Damaged by the fire but can be repaired with a **COM-TECH** and Shift of work
  - Damaged senors sporadically pick up [sensor ghost](#sensor-ghost-redux)
- Life Support Monitors
  - When power is restored the monitors will flash red due to the high carbon dioxide levels
  - It says maintenance must be performed on the air scrubbers either [replaced](#bad-air)
  - If PCs talk to MU/TH/UR before restoring power to this terminal she shares the same info
- Pilot Station
  - An axe is embedded in Station 1 and Station 2 is dead regardless if the power is restored
  - It is possible to open up the deck plating and try to reconnect power **HEAVY MACHINERY** for one Shift of work
  - Faster, easier solution would be to cannibalize Station 2 to repair sation 1 **COM-TECH +2** for one shift of work
  - Only one pilot station is needed to fly the ship

#### Crew Quarters

- All rooms are locked tight, ranascked, or smell like death
- Small personal items of worth can be found here but the crew of the Cronus won't be happy if taken

#### Mess Hall

- Food stores are ravaged and most of the exposed food stores are rotten
- Someone had been making origami anmals out of metallic paper and setting them up around the room
- These animals are made by Ava in her deranged state

#### Corporate Suite

- Clayton's wardroom and quarters is spacious and was luxurious but now a ruin with blood on the bed, sofa storn apart and furniture is destroyed
- Drugs
  - Under the mattress is a pack of illegal stimulants to be injected into the ocular cavity. Reduces **STRESS LEVEL** to 0. D6 doses
- Wall Safe
  - Only accessible via Clayton's code containing
    - encrypted Modular Computing Device cube storing all data on the science mission to LV-1113
    - 1 million dollars in cash
  - Without code the safe can be cracked **COM-TECH -3** and 1 shift of work
  - The door can be blown open with an explosion with **BLAST POWER 12** which damages the cube and destorys most of the cash
- Wetbar
  - Bar is cleaved in two and most bottles are destroyed
- Closet / Escape Pod
  - Anyone examining the closet realises that it also functions as an EEV - escape pod
  - Escape Pod is functional but can only be accessed with Clayton's code
  - Escape Pod has three cryo-pods but not FTL capable
