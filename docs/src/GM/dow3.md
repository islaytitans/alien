- Don't forget cover, can recover stress and health by resting for a Turn... if you can find somewhere safe to hold up
- Read what's the story mother
- Recap
  - Planet is an oil refinery on boundry between UPP and UA
  - UPP and UA are on the brink of war with Insurgents on the planet undermining the UA
  - Colonial Marines have refinforced the planet and its space elevator
  - Your team were told to bring in 4 AWOL Marines
  - You tracked them down and only managed to recover one Alive
  - They tell you that they've been infected with an Alien Embryo as part of the Project Life force
  - Their squad we're experimented on with the embryo inside
  - They were going to turncoat to the UPP for hope of removal of the alien embryos.
  - You found the last one in a Insurgents compound and they turned into a freak

## Session Open

- Begin a few blocks away from Fort Nebraska
- "Act 3 - The Lions Den"

  - Mammoth shadow of a ship stops above the colony about 4km from the PCs
  - **Give the PCs time to find cover**
  - _Read out loud Black Death p57_
  - **+1 Stress**
  - p59 for bomb range chart and select the location so PCs are on the Periphery
    - Locations with sealed air supply will protect them from infection
