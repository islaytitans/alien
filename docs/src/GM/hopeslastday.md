## LV-426

## Mandatory Events

### Opening

- As the adventure starts, the PCs stagger back to the colony. Let the players describe their characters to each other and banter for a bit during the walk. Then show the players the colony overview map (on the inside of the front cover of this booklet and printed separately in the boxed set) and give each player their personal agenda card for act I.
- Also, all PCs except Holroyd suffer from hunger and thirst and must make a SURVIVAL roll to avoid being fatigued (page 22 in the Rules booklet). Another roll must be made each shift unless the PCs find food and water (assuming they live that long).
- The PCs arrive from the south, so the South Lock is the closest. The South Wing is also where the colony’s central Operations room is located, as well as the Weyland-Yutani office, so it’s the obvious place to go. In fact, the East, West, and North Locks are all sealed shut from the inside, which the PCs will realize if they go there.
  This means that the only accessible ways into the colony are the South Lock and the emergency door to Tannen’s Casino (page 10). The PCs might also want to go directly to the Starcub shuttle sitting on the Landing Pad (page 12).
