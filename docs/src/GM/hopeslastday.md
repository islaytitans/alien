# Hopes Last Day

## Party

## Session Open

- Read what's the story mother
- Remind roll are less often than d&d only when failure has significant impact
- They have motion detector
- [Staggering from the south ](#opening)

## Hadley's Hope

### Outside

- Despite the Xenomorphs lurking inside the base, it should still feel like a safer place to be than going outside.
- Outside, it takes a stretch of time and a successful SURVIVAL roll for each PC to walk between two Locks (or the door to Tannen’s), due to the heavy rain and wind. Failure means they fall behind and need to roll again.
- For each stretch spent outside, roll a stress die. On a (or whenever you feel it’s dramatically appropriate) a Drone Xenomorph approaches the PCs. Make an opposed OBSERVATION roll as per the stealth mode rules.

### Other Areas

- LARGE AREAS OF THE HADLEY’S HOPE colony are out of scope for this adventure, and there are no interior maps provided for them. This includes the West, North, and East Wings of the colony, along with the Central Unit and Sublevels, as well as the huge atmosphere processor near the colony.
- The PCs have no incentives to go to these locations in the adventure. If they insist on going anyway, they will be attacked by an increasing number of Drone Xenomorphs, as these areas are all heavily infested

## South Wing

- THE SOUTH WING of Hadley’s Hope is the nerve center of the colony, containing key installations like the Operations Room, Weyland-Yutani Office, and Medlab.
- This is also where the colonists tried – and failed – to make a last stand against the Xenomorphs, barricading all entrances except the South Lock doors.
- Some Xenos still made it in through the air ducts, killing or abducting everyone inside.

### Corridors

- The corridors inside the South Wing are eerily empty, but the PCs can see marks from what look like gunshots and explosions on the walls and ceiling.
- Water from broken coolant pipes is dripping from the ceiling, and the air has an acrid smell.
- The power is still on, but the lights flicker ominously.
- Acid Burns: If the PCs investigate any corridor and make an OBSERVATION roll, they will spot strange burn like marks on the floor.

### Comms

- There is a comm unit in every zone of the South Wing and Tannen’s Casino, excluding corridors, storage rooms and restrooms.
- These can be used to talk to any other room with a comm unit.

### Doors

- Unless stated otherwise, any door inside the South Wing can be opened by a simple push of a button next to it (no
  action). Locking (or unlocking, unless sealed) a door is a quick action.
- Sealing Doors: A door can be electronically sealed with a COMTECH roll (full action) Opening such a sealed door requires a similar COMTECH roll (except for the person who sealed the door). A door can also be sealed manually by using a cutting torch – this requires a HEAVY MACHINERY
  roll (full action).
- Breaching Doors: A locked or sealed door or hatch can be breached by close combat attacks (full action) with +2 dice. Unless stated otherwise, a door has armor level 2 and breaks after 10 points of damage. A locked door can also be opened by a cutting torch or a maintenance jack and a HEAVY MACHINERY roll (full action). A breached door cannot be locked again.
- Xenomorphs: Larger Xenomorphs (Drones but not Facehuggers or Chestbursters) can break down doors. They use their Headbite attack (nine dice, base damage 2, armor piercing) to do this.
- Barricades: The main doors to the Central Unit and the East Wing, on both levels, are barricaded from the inside with heavy equipment and can only be opened after a shift of work and a HEAVY MACHINERY roll. The Xenomorphs will breach these barricades at the end of the adventure (see Final Horrors on page 14).

### Stairway & Elevator

- There is one stairway and one freight elevator in the South Wing, as indicated on the map.
- The stairway allows movement between the two levels (one move in stealth mode, quick action in combat) as well as down to the multiple sublevels below. However, the stairways down end in barricades as per above.
- The freight elevator is damaged and stuck on level 1. It can be repaired with a successful HEAVY MACHINERY roll and a stretch of work and will then carry up to six people between the floors in one round (quick action to operate). It’s also possible to climb the shaft (one move in stealth mode, full action in combat), but that requires a MOBILITY roll with failure causing a fall of D3+1 meters.

### Air Ducts

- There are air ducts throughout the South Wing, marked on the map including access points. At four points, marked A, B, C and D, there are vertical ducts allowing movement between level 1 and 2 (one move in stealth mode, quick action in combat). The air ducts are crawlspaces as per the rules on page 9 in the Rules booklet.
- Sealing Access Points: An access point can be sealed shut with a cutting torch by making a HEAVY MACHINERY roll (full action). A sealed access point has armor level 2 and breaks after 8 points of damage.
- Central Unit: The air ducts leading off the map to the Central Unit of the map (one on each level) are the way the Xenomorphs move in and out of the South Wing. Any PC trying to come this way will face one or more Drones lurking here, effectively blocking the way.

## Tannen's Casino

THE FRESH BLING can’t hide the utilitarian nature of this place. There is a walkway from the upper floor of the casino to level 2 of the South Wing.

### The Bodies

- There are five bodies stacked against the walkway door on the casino side. They fall in a cascade of gore if that door is opened from the outside, giving stress level +1 to all who see it and a panic roll for the one who opened the door – and alerting the Xenomorph downstairs.
- One victim, [Angela Lin](#angela-lin), is alive but unconscious. She has been facehugged and may soon birth a Chestburster

### The Bar

- There is a bar on the ground floor of Tannen’s Casino. Here, a Drone lurks, trying to get into the service area behind the bar where the colonist [Wes Osterman](#wes-osterman) is trapped inside. - The Xeno is passive in relation to the PCs until alerted. [See the event “A Cry for Help”](#a-cry-for-help). If the PCs wait too long, the Xeno will break down the door and kill poor Wes.

## Landing Pad

- OUTSIDE THE NORTH SHIELD WALL of the colony is the Landing Pad, with an adjoining Air Traffic Control Center.
- The ATCC building has a storeroom and generator on the ground floor, and the control room with panoramic windowson the first floor. There is no power to the ATCC, and no way to fix it.

### The Shuttle

- A modified Lockmart Starcub with planetfall capacity rests on the far side of the landing pad. It can carry up to ten people at a squeeze but only has two cryobeds.
- However, it is securely clamped to the ground as a result of the automatic lockdown procedure, and one of the clamps completely blocks the access hatch.
- The only way to release the shuttle is to use the keycard carried by Komiskey.
- The shuttle is the likely scene for the finale of the adventure. [See final horrors](#final-horrors)

## Mandatory Events

### Opening

- PCs stagger back to the colony
- Let the players describe their characters to each other and banter for a bit during the walk.
- Give each player their personal agenda card for act I.
- Show colony overview map
- Also, all PCs except Holroyd suffer from hunger and thirst and must make a SURVIVAL roll to avoid being fatigued.
  - Another roll must be made each shift unless the PCs find food and water (assuming they live that long).
- The PCs arrive from the south, so the South Lock is the closest. The South Wing is also where the colony’s central Operations room is located, as well as the Weyland-Yutani office, so it’s the obvious place to go.
  - The only accessible ways into the colony are the South Lock and the emergency door to Tannen’s Casino. The doors open without trouble
  - The East, West, and North Locks are all sealed shut from the inside
  - The PCs might also want to go directly to the Starcub shuttle sitting on the Landing Pad.
- Once inside the PCs can
  - explore freely
  - access colony overview map from a terminal

### Act 2 Begins

- Begins when PCs see their first Xenomorph
- Give out agenda cards

### Act 3 Begins

- Begins when the PCs have talked to Dr. Komiskey in the Medlab
- Give out agenda cards

### Hunted

- At no point should the PCs feel safe. If they stay for too long in one place or start to get complacent, one or more Drones arrive from the nearby hive (through the air ducts to the Central Unit) and start to stalk them.

### The Gunshot

- In the dead silence, the PCs hear a sudden gunshot and a lonesome scream that echoes through the ventilation
  ducts – stress level +1 for all. The shot originates from the East Geological Lab on level 1, which the PCs can discern with an OBSERVATION roll (no action).

### A Cry for Help

- An intercom buzzer sounds close to the PCs, loud in the quiet, making them all jump. The colonist Wes Osterman
  (page 10) is trapped in the bar in Tannen’s Casino.
- He keeps buzzing until they answer and then he will beg for help. If they don’t answer, the noise will make any Xenos in their area active.
- Osterman says he has locked the door, but something is trying to get in. In the background they can hear the dull thump, thump, thump of something heavy battering the door to the bar.
- If they decide to help Wes, see [Tannen's Casino](#tannens-casino).
- If they wait too long to decide, they hear the door to the bar give way, along with the squeals of the Xeno and the screams of Osterman as he is taken away to the hive (stress level +1).

### We Got Movement

- If the PCs use a motion detector, they suddenly detect a ping in the Sterile Lab on level 1. The ping remains if they try it again. This ping is from a mouse in the [lab](#the-lab), but the PCs won’t know that until they get there.

### The Mystery Ping

- When using a motion detector, the PCs suddenly detect a ping in a nearby air duct. If they investigate, they only find the headless remains of a children’s doll.
- The ping was actually Rebecca “Newt” Jorden, daughter to the prospector Russ Jorden. She stays away and the PCs have no way to find her or interact with her during this adventure

### Power Cut

- Suddenly, all of the lights go out in the South Wing, and a dim emergency light flickers on. In the darkness,
  all OBSERVATION rolls are made with –2 dice. Did the Xenomorphs do this?
- The power can be restored in the Life Support / Power room on level 2.

### The Birth

- If the PCs have rescued Dr. Komiskey from the Medlab or Angela Lin from Tannen’s Casino, the Chestbursters
  inside them will be born sooner or later.
- If a PC has been facehugged, this can happen to them as well. This is probably the first time the PCs witness such an event, triggering an immediate panic roll.

## Final horrors

### Finale

The only way to escape Hadley’s Hope is via the Starcub corporate shuttle on the Landing Pad. However, to operate it they need a corporate key card – something only Miranda Reynolds and her chief science officer Theodora Komiskey have (and only Komiskey’s works). Once the players realize this and have retrieved the key card, the finale of the adventure begins. See page 14

## Characters

### Wes Osterman

- In Tannen's Casino
- Osterman’s new life at Hadley’s Hope is his last chance, given how
  hard he’s found it to hold down a solid job. He maintains heating systems for a living. When ordered back to his quarters he displayed the same lack of discipline that’s hounded him his entire life and said, “Damn it, I’m going to the bar for a drink!”

### Angela Lin

- In Tannen's Casino
- Lin is a mess. Wounded and left unconscious among her friends by the Xenomorph, she’s scared and confused. She’s unaware of being facehugged but feels that something is horribly wrong.

### Grey

> Service Android

> Docile

> Wants to serve humankind

## Enemies

- A Drone lurking in the corridor by the walkway to Tannen’s Casino on level 2. It hears the PCs enter-ing the base and starts stalking them immediately, moving through the halls or air vents. This Drone
- may trigger the PCs’ motion detector.
- A Drone hiding in the air vent next to the Weyland-Yutani Office on level 1. It remains still until the PCs arrive and won’t trigger the motion detector until then.
- A Drone inside Tannen’s Casino, trying to break through the door to the service area behind the bar where Wes Osterman is hiding.
- One Ovomorph (alien egg) in the Medlab (page 8).
- Two live Facehuggers in the Stasis Room. These are unable to attack the PCs unless released.
- A Chestburster growing inside Dr. Komiskey in the Surgery Room.
- A Chestburster inside the dead colonist John J. Marachuk in the Morgue.
- Several more Drones are lurking in the air ducts leading north to the Central Unit, and behind the barricades to the Central Unit, East Lock and Sub-Levels. These will attack any PCs trying to come this way. Such Drones may enter the South Wing during the scenario (see Events).
