# Hopes Last Day

## Session Open

- Remind roll are less often than d&d only when failure has significant impact
- Read what's the story mother
- [Staggering from the south ](#opening)

## Hadley's Hope

### Outside

- Despite the Xenomorphs lurking inside the base, it should still feel like a safer place to be than going outside.
- Outside, it takes a stretch of time and a successful SURVIVAL roll for each PC to walk between two Locks (or the door to Tannen’s), due to the heavy rain and wind. Failure means they fall behind and need to roll again.
- For each stretch spent outside, roll a stress die. On a (or whenever you feel it’s dramatically appropriate) a Drone Xenomorph approaches the PCs. Make an opposed OBSERVATION roll as per the stealth mode rules.
- **Xenomorph** Drones are lurking in the air ducts leading north to the Central Unit, and behind the barricades to the Central Unit, East Lock and Sub-Levels. These will attack any PCs trying to come this way. Such Drones may enter the South Wing during the scenario (see Events).

### Other Areas

- LARGE AREAS OF THE HADLEY’S HOPE colony are out of scope for this adventure, and there are no interior maps provided for them. This includes the West, North, and East Wings of the colony, along with the Central Unit and Sublevels, as well as the huge atmosphere processor near the colony.
- The PCs have no incentives to go to these locations in the adventure. If they insist on going anyway, they will be attacked by an increasing number of Drone Xenomorphs, as these areas are all heavily infested

## South Wing

- THE SOUTH WING of Hadley’s Hope is the nerve center of the colony, containing key installations like the Operations Room, Weyland-Yutani Office, and Medlab.
- This is also where the colonists tried – and failed – to make a last stand against the Xenomorphs, barricading all entrances except the South Lock doors.
- Some Xenos still made it in through the air ducts, killing or abducting everyone inside.

### Corridors

- The corridors inside the South Wing are eerily empty, but the PCs can see marks from what look like gunshots and explosions on the walls and ceiling.
- Water from broken coolant pipes is dripping from the ceiling, and the air has an acrid smell.
- The power is still on, but the lights flicker ominously.
- **Acid Burns**: If the PCs investigate any corridor and make an OBSERVATION roll, they will spot strange burn like marks on the floor.

### Comms

- There is a comm unit in every zone of the South Wing and Tannen’s Casino, excluding corridors, storage rooms and restrooms.
- These can be used to talk to any other room with a comm unit.

### Doors

- Unless stated otherwise, any door inside the South Wing can be opened by a simple push of a button next to it (no
  action). Locking (or unlocking, unless sealed) a door is a quick action.
- **Sealing Doors**: A door can be electronically sealed with a COMTECH roll (full action) Opening such a sealed door requires a similar COMTECH roll (except for the person who sealed the door). A door can also be sealed manually by using a cutting torch – this requires a HEAVY MACHINERY roll (full action).
- **Breaching Doors**: A locked or sealed door or hatch can be breached by close combat attacks (full action) with +2 dice. Unless stated otherwise, a door has armor level 2 and breaks after 10 points of damage. A locked door can also be opened by a cutting torch or a maintenance jack and a HEAVY MACHINERY roll (full action). A breached door cannot be locked again.
- **Xenomorphs**: Larger Xenomorphs (Drones but not Facehuggers or Chestbursters) can break down doors. They use their Headbite attack (nine dice, base damage 2, armor piercing) to do this.
- **Barricades**: The main doors to the Central Unit and the East Wing, on both levels, are barricaded from the inside with heavy equipment and can only be opened after a shift of work and a HEAVY MACHINERY roll. The Xenomorphs will breach these barricades at the end of the adventure (see Final Horrors on page 14).

### Stairway & Elevator

- There is one stairway and one freight elevator in the South Wing, as indicated on the map.
- The stairway allows movement between the two levels (one move in stealth mode, quick action in combat) as well as down to the multiple sublevels below. However, the stairways down end in barricades as per above.
- **Freight elevator** is damaged and stuck on level 1. It can be repaired with a successful HEAVY MACHINERY roll and a stretch of work and will then carry up to six people between the floors in one round (quick action to operate). It’s also possible to climb the shaft (one move in stealth mode, full action in combat), but that requires a MOBILITY roll with failure causing a fall of D3+1 meters.

### Air Ducts

- There are air ducts throughout the South Wing, marked on the map including access points. At four points, marked A, B, C and D, there are vertical ducts allowing movement between level 1 and 2 (one move in stealth mode, quick action in combat). The air ducts are crawlspaces as per the rules on page 9 in the Rules booklet.
- **Sealing Access Points**: An access point can be sealed shut with a cutting torch by making a HEAVY MACHINERY roll (full action). A sealed access point has armor level 2 and breaks after 8 points of damage.
- **Central Unit**: The air ducts leading off the map to the Central Unit of the map (one on each level) are the way the Xenomorphs move in and out of the South Wing. Any PC trying to come this way will face one or more Drones lurking here, effectively blocking the way.

## Level 1

### Storage Rooms

- There are several storage rooms throughout the South Wing, marked on the map. These have been ransacked
  by panicking colonists
- If the PCs spend a stretch searching a storage room, let them make an OBSERVATION roll. For each rolled, roll once on the adjacent table. Re-roll any duplicates.
  - Fire Axe
  - Bolt Gun
  - Power cell
  - Medkit
  - Flashlight
  - Tape Recorder
- A storage room can only be searched once, but several PCs can help. Note that the storage room behind the Station Maintenance Center on level 2 is an armory with a different random table (page 10).

### Geolab West

- This cluttered laboratory was used to track the progress of LV-426’s terraforming.
- Now, it is deserted. A half-eaten doughnut sits on a desk in the eastern lab (relieves fatigue from hunger for one PC)

### Sterile Lab

- This deserted laboratory holds little of interest except some half-finished cups of coffee and a small cage with two mice in it. These mice can trigger motion detectors see [we've got movement](#we-got-movement)

### Survey Office

- Another deserted office. There is a decent – and still functional – coffee machine on a side desk. A cup gives
  stress level +1 but postpones fatigue from lack of sleep for one shift.
- Also, if the PCs make any kind of noise in here, the Drone hiding in the nearby air vent will be alerted and
  start stalking them.

### Weyland-Yutani Office

- Operations Manager Al Simpson’s cluttered office was recently commandeered by corporate agent Miranda Reynolds.
- **Miranda Reynolds** is in the northernmost chair, facing away from the door. She seems to be sitting quietly with her head down, snoozing maybe.
  - A small ventilation grill on the opposite wall has been battered free
  - Reynolds is dead, having been brutally killed by a Xenomorph Drone. Her face and neck are a bloody mess (stress level +1 for all who see her). The Keycard: A keycard hangs around Reynolds’ neck on a Weyland-Yutani lanyard. This is the type of card required to start the shuttle on the Landing Pad. If a PC removes the keycard and wipes the gore away (stress level +1), they realize it’s destroyed beyond repair.
- **Comms on the desk**, spattered with Reynolds’ blood, is a small hand-held comms device, linked to Dr. Komiskey. A light on it is blinking. Komiskey has been desperately trying to call Reynolds for help, ever since she awoke trapped in the Medlab.
  - If the PCs answer, they can talk to Komiskey, who is in the Surgery Room on level 2. She is in shock, sounding vague and distant. [She asks for help](#theodora-komiskey)
- A **Drone Xenomorph** is hiding motionless in the air vent next to the office. If still here when the PCs enter, it will become active and start stalking them. It will attack at an opportune moment. If the PCs linger in the office, the Xeno can even attack them here.

### Geolab East

- This room is a horror show.
- Tables and chairs are thrown about, the air reeks of gun smoke, and there is blood everywhere – stress level +1. There are no bodies here, but there is a thick blood smear on the wall, leading up to the air duct grill in the ceiling.
- If the PCs search the room (OBSERVATION roll and a stretch of time) they find an M4A3 Service Pistol in the mess (loaded).

### Geological Manager Office

- This room is littered with coffee cups and the bins are full.
- If searched, a successful OBSERVATION roll (one stretch) will allow the PCs to find some junk food (relieves fatigue from hunger for two PCs).

### Assistant Manager Office

- This stuffy little office that used to belong to Assistant Operations Manager Lydecker is largely untouched.
- If searched, a successful OBSERVATION roll (one stretch) will let the PCs find a key marked Armory in a drawer.

### Asset/Claims Office

- If searched, a successful OBSERVATION roll (one stretch) will let the PCs find D6×100 W-Y dollars in cash, a water bottle and a candy bar (relieves fatigue from thirst and hunger for one PC).

## Level 2

### Operations

- “Ops” is the nerve center of the colony, monitoring vital functions and security. It’s usually busy but right now it’s unmanned. The intercom hisses static and a screen flickers.
- **CCTV system**: is damaged, but a successful COMTECH roll gives access to a few cameras. Flicking through, the PCs see the following:
  - View of carnage in the other Wings and the Sublevels. There are signs of a terrible battle, doors torn apart and ceiling and floor panels shredded. There are some mutilated bodies, but not as many as they might imagine. Stress level +1 for all who see it. This should discourage players from trying to enter these areas.
  - Tannen’s Casino, seemingly deserted, until a disturbingly large and unnatural shadow suddenly comes into view. The PCs can’t quite make out what it is.
  - A corridor where a Drone Xenomorph is lurking right now (if there is one). The PCs can only watch it standing there, its eyeless head raised, its whip of a tail languidly carving the air - stress level +1 if this is their first view of a Drone.
  - The landing pad, showing the Starcub corporate shuttle sitting there, lashed by rain and wind. No one seems to be around.
- **Personal Data Transmitters**: All colonists of Hadley’s Hope are equipped with surgically implanted “PDTs” which transmit their location at all times. These can be tracked from Ops with a COMTECH roll. If successful, the PCs can find the following (modify if these people have moved):
  - Company Agent Miranda Reynolds is in the W-Y Office on level 1.
  - W-Y science officer Theodora Komiskey is in the Surgery Room on level 2.
  - Operations Manager Al Simpson and the colonist John J. Marachuk are in the Morgue on level 2.
  - Five colonists, including Angela Lin, seem to have converged on the skywalk to Tannen’s Casino on level 2.
  - Service Technician Wes Osterman is inside Tannen’s Casino.
  - Strangely, no other colonists seem to be present in the main colony buildings. The PCs are not able to scan further afield than that at this time.

### Medlab

- The Medlab includes a medical station for biochemistry analysis, a biological safety cabinet, cooler compartments, and windows into the adjacent Stasis Room and Surgery Room. The place is in shambles, empty cabinets flung open and over-turned in the mad scramble for medical supplies.
- **Operating Room Windows**: Inside the adjacent dimly lit Surgery Room, the PCs suddenly see a pale-faced woman, pressing her hand on the glass – stress level +1 for all PCs present. This is [Dr. Komiskey](#theodora-komiskey), the Weyland-Yutani science officer (next page). Along with Komiskey, the PCs can see what looks like a dead spider-like creature on the floor (a Facehugger).
- **Surgical Access**: Access to the Surgery Room goes through the adjacent Stasis Room. The windows to the Medlab have armor level 2 and will shatter if any attack breaches them.
- **Intercom**: The PC can speak to Komiskey over the comms. For more about interacting with Dr. Komiskey, [see the here](#theodora-komiskey).
  - **Act 3** begins after they talk with Komiskey
- **The Egg**: If the PCs open the cooler compartments in the Medlab, they will find a large, leathery egg kept in a deep freeze. This is an Ovomorph – a Xenomorph egg, kept inert by the cold. If taken out, it will thaw and become active – and very dangerous – within one stretch. There are several medical containers in the Medlab that can be used to carry the egg. It counts as one inventory item.
- **Hyper-Coolant Spray**: In a cabinet in the Medlab, there is a canister with a hyper-coolant spray used by Dr. Komiskey’s team to keep the eggs dormant for transport. Each use keeps one egg dormant for one stretch of time. The remaining canister has a Supply rating of 3. If released, Dr. Komiskey will tell the PCs about the egg and the spray.

### Stasis Room

- This cramped room is used for access to the Surgery Room as well as biopsy storage and regrowth tubes. There are seven large glass tubes on desks here, each containing a spiderlike Facehugger floating in liquid. Five of these are dead, but two are alive – surgically removed before embryo implantation, killing their victims in the process (including the colonist John J. Marachuk, who can be found in the Morgue).
- **The Facehuggers**: If a PC comes near a tube, one Facehugger will suddenly react, thrashing with its tail – stress level +1 for the PC. The tubes can be moved and carried (counts as one inventory item) and even thrown into an adjacent room or zone – a living Facehugger will then be freed and attacks immediately.
- **Surgical Access**: This room has a viewing window and a door to the adjacent Surgery Room. The door is locked and cannot be opened from the inside. From the outside, it can be opened with a COMTECH roll, or broken down by 10 points of damage (armor level 2) – a sure way to alert the Drone in the level 1 corridor just underneath, and any other Xenos nearby. The window to the Medlab has armor level 2 and will shatter if any attack breaches it.

### Surgery Room

- This operating theater for ambulatory surgery is dominated by a large Pauling Surgical & Scanner MedPod. It also has a patient rest bed in a corner. Along with Komiskey, there is a dead Facehugger on the floor.
- **The Medpod**: The Pauling MedPod is an autonomous medical scanner and surgical unit. It can treat infections and perform basic wound repair and pre-programmed surgical procedures. The MedPod features an airtight operating shield, comfortable limb restraints, a laser scalpel, computer controlled robotic surgical arms, liquid spray anesthetic and vital signs sensors.
  - Effect: The MedPod can administer first aid and perform surgery with MEDICAL AID skill level 10 (the roll cannot be pushed).

### Morgue

- This cold, sparse room is dominated by a large metal slab, on which lies the body of a man, seemingly very dead. This is John J. Marachuk, a colonist who was facehugged and died during the attempt to remove the Xenomorph from his face.
  - If the PCs examine the body and make an OBSERVATION roll (takes one stretch of time), they can determine that he was likely killed by strangulation and a snapped neck.
- **The Chestburster**: When the PCs are in the Morgue, a Chestburster will suddenly break its way out of the chest of the dead Marachuk in a spray of gore, and attack. All PCs present must make a panic roll. The Facehugger had already implanted the embryo in the poor colonist when he died, and it grew from the nutrients of his body after death.
- **Mortuary Coolers**: These compartments are used to store dead bodies. They are all empty, except one, which contains Operations Manager Al Simpson, who was killed during the Xenomorphs’ attack.
- **Office**: The small office at the back of the Morgue holds little of interest, beyond a water bottle on the desk. If searched, a successful OBSERVATION roll (one stretch) will let the PCs find a key marked Armory in a drawer.

### Station Maintenance Center

- This area is a mess with wall panels ripped off and water dripping from the ceiling. If searched, a successful OBSERVATION roll (one stretch) will let the PCs find a cutting torch (fully charged) in this room.
- **Armory**: The storage room in the back is actually an armory and marked as such on the door. The door is locked (keys can be found in the Morgue and the W-Y Manager Office on level 1). It can be opened with a COMTECH roll at –2 dice or brute force (10 points of damage, armor level 2) – the latter solution will alert all Xenos nearby. The armory was largely emptied when the colonists armed themselves to fend off the Xenos threat, but if the PCs spend a stretch searching it, let them make an OBSERVATION roll. For each rolled, roll once on the table below. Re-roll any duplicates. The armory can only be searched once, but several PCs can help.
  1. M4A3 Service Pistol (loaded, one reload)
  2. M240 Incinerator Unit (no reloads)
  3. Armat Model 37A2 12 Gauge Pump Action (loaded, no reloads)
  4. .357 Magnum (loaded, no reloads)
  5. Armat M41A Pulse Rifle (loaded with both bullets and grenades, no reloads)
  6. D6 M40 HEDP Hand Grenades

### Life Support/Power

- In this cramped room, power can be turned off (and back on) throughout the colony with a COMTECH roll and a stretch of time.
- Turning off the power will trigger a dim red emergency light throughout the base. In the dark, OBSERVATION rolls get –2 dice for the PCs (Xenos are not affected). In addition, any items with a Power supply can be recharged in one stretch of time in this room.

### Walkway to Tannen's Casino

- Corridor walkway through to Tannen's Casino
- **Xeno** Drone started hear but turned active when the PCs entered the South Wing

## Tannen's Casino

- THE FRESH BLING can’t hide the utilitarian nature of this place. There is a walkway from the upper floor of the casino to level 2 of the South Wing.

### The Bodies

- There are five bodies stacked against the walkway door on the casino side. They fall in a cascade of gore if that door is opened from the outside, giving stress level +1 to all who see it and a panic roll for the one who opened the door – and alerting the Xenomorph downstairs.
- One victim, [Angela Lin](#angela-lin), is alive but unconscious. She has been facehugged and may soon birth a Chestburster

### The Bar

- There is a bar on the ground floor of Tannen’s Casino.
- **Xenomorph** Drone lurks, trying to get into the service area behind the bar where the colonist [Wes Osterman](#wes-osterman) is trapped inside.
  - The Xeno is passive in relation to the PCs until alerted.
- [See the event “A Cry for Help”](#a-cry-for-help). If the PCs wait too long, the Xeno will break down the door and kill poor Wes.

## Landing Pad

- OUTSIDE THE NORTH SHIELD WALL of the colony is the Landing Pad, with an adjoining Air Traffic Control Center.
- The ATCC building has a storeroom and generator on the ground floor, and the control room with panoramic windowson the first floor. There is no power to the ATCC, and no way to fix it.

### The Shuttle

- A modified Lockmart Starcub with planetfall capacity rests on the far side of the landing pad. It can carry up to ten people at a squeeze but only has two cryobeds.
- However, it is securely clamped to the ground as a result of the automatic lockdown procedure, and one of the clamps completely blocks the access hatch.
- The only way to release the shuttle is to use the keycard carried by Komiskey.
- The shuttle is the likely scene for the finale of the adventure. [See final horrors](#final-horrors)

## Events

### Opening

- PCs stagger back to the colony
- Let the players describe their characters to each other and banter for a bit during the walk.
- Give each player their personal agenda card for act I.
- Show colony overview map
- Also, all PCs except Holroyd suffer from hunger and thirst and must make a SURVIVAL roll to avoid being fatigued.
  - Another roll must be made each shift unless the PCs find food and water (assuming they live that long).
- The PCs arrive from the south, so the South Lock is the closest. The South Wing is also where the colony’s central Operations room is located, as well as the Weyland-Yutani office, so it’s the obvious place to go.
  - The only accessible ways into the colony are the South Lock and the emergency door to Tannen’s Casino. The doors open without trouble
  - The East, West, and North Locks are all sealed shut from the inside
  - The PCs might also want to go directly to the Starcub shuttle sitting on the Landing Pad.
- Once inside the PCs can
  - explore freely
  - access colony overview map from a terminal
  - They have motion detector
- **Act 2** begins after they see their first Xenomorph
- **Xenos**: A Drone lurking in the corridor by the walkway to Tannen’s Casino on level 2.
  - It hears the PCs entering the base and starts stalking them immediately, moving through the halls or air vents. This Drone may trigger the PCs’ motion detector.

### Hunted

- At no point should the PCs feel safe. If they stay for too long in one place or start to get complacent, one or more Drones arrive from the nearby hive (through the air ducts to the Central Unit) and start to stalk them.

### The Gunshot

- In the dead silence, the PCs hear a sudden gunshot and a lonesome scream that echoes through the ventilation ducts – stress level +1 for all.
- The shot originates from the East Geological Lab on level 1, which the PCs can discern with an OBSERVATION roll (no action).

### A Cry for Help

- An intercom buzzer sounds close to the PCs, loud in the quiet, making them all jump. The colonist [Wes Osterman](#wes-osterman) is trapped in the bar in Tannen’s Casino.
- He keeps buzzing until they answer and then he will beg for help. If they don’t answer, the noise will make any Xenos in their area active.
- Osterman says he has locked the door, but something is trying to get in. In the background they can hear the dull thump, thump, thump of something heavy battering the door to the bar.
- If they decide to help Wes, see [Tannen's Casino](#tannens-casino).
- If they wait too long to decide, they hear the door to the bar give way, along with the squeals of the Xeno and the screams of Osterman as he is taken away to the hive (stress level +1).

### We Got Movement

- If the PCs use a motion detector, they suddenly detect a ping in the Sterile Lab on level 1. The ping remains if they try it again. This ping is from a mouse in the [lab](#the-lab), but the PCs won’t know that until they get there.

### The Mystery Ping

- When using a motion detector, the PCs suddenly detect a ping in a nearby air duct. If they investigate, they only find the headless remains of a children’s doll.
- The ping was actually Rebecca “Newt” Jorden, daughter to the prospector Russ Jorden. She stays away and the PCs have no way to find her or interact with her during this adventure

### Power Cut

- Suddenly, all of the lights go out in the South Wing, and a dim emergency light flickers on. In the darkness, all OBSERVATION rolls are made with –2 dice. Did the Xenomorphs do this?
- The power can be restored in the Life Support / Power room on level 2.

### The Birth

- If the PCs have rescued Dr. Komiskey from the Medlab or Angela Lin from Tannen’s Casino, the Chestbursters inside them will be born sooner or later.
- If a PC has been facehugged, this can happen to them as well. This is probably the first time the PCs witness such an event, triggering an immediate panic roll.

## Final horrors - Act 3

### Finale

The only way to escape Hadley’s Hope is via the Starcub corporate shuttle on the Landing Pad. However, to operate it they need a corporate key card – something only Miranda Reynolds and her chief science officer Theodora Komiskey have (and only Komiskey’s works). Once the players realize this and have retrieved the key card, the finale of the adventure begins. See page 14

### The Swarm

- The PCs suddenly hear heavy thumping sounds. An OBSERVATION roll (no action) will let them understand that it’s coming from the barricades leading to the Central Unit and the Sublevels. The Xenomorphs have noticed the PCs and sent a swarm to capture them!
- Within minutes, the South Wing will be overrun by Drones. The players should understand that their only way to survive Hope’s Last Day is to use the shuttle on the Landing Pad to escape. If the PCs are having an easy time, let the barricades break and have the PCs face a Drone or two on the way out.

### To The Shuttle

- When the PCs make their final dash for the shuttle, the Xenos will be after them. Each of them must make a successful MOBILITY roll to reach the Landing Pad.
  - A failed roll means that the PC falls behind. Other PCs can choose to wait, meaning they also need to roll again, or leave the failing PC behind.
- If any PC fails three MOBILITY rolls, a Drone Xeno has caught up with them and attacks. The attack is deemed surprising, and the Xeno gets the #1 initiative card. If they survive this fight, they reach the shuttle.

### Taking Off

- As the PCs and any NPC survivors reach the shuttle, Komiskey’s key card is needed to open the hatch and scramble inside.
- The swarm is outside, banging on the hatch, and one PC needs to make a PILOTING roll to power up the engines and take off. Several attempts are allowed, but each failed roll means stress level +1 for everyone inside

### A Nasty Surprise

- Finally off the ground, the PCs may believe their trials are over – but they are in for a nasty surprise. Miranda’s team had been busy, gathering a number of eggs (equal to the number of PCs who made it here), and storing them inside the shuttle (in the small room to the right).
- The problem is, the coolant that they applied to the eggs (page 8) wore off faster than expected. Now, the eggs are very much active. As soon as a PC or NPC enters the room where they are stored, or at any point you want, the eggs are immediately activated and each discharges a Facehugger, which immediately attacks – stress level +1 for all.
- If any of the PCs survive the final attack, their final fate is beyond the bounds of this adventure. No record of the whereabouts of these characters exists beyond their departure from LV-426

## Characters

### Wes Osterman

- In Tannen's Casino
- Osterman’s new life at Hadley’s Hope is his last chance, given how hard he’s found it to hold down a solid job. He maintains heating systems for a living. When ordered back to his quarters he displayed the same lack of discipline that’s hounded him his entire life and said, “Damn it, I’m going to the bar for a drink!”

### Angela Lin

- In Tannen's Casino
- Lin is a mess. Wounded and left unconscious among her friends by the Xenomorph, she’s scared and confused. She’s unaware of being facehugged but feels that something is horribly wrong.

### Theodora Komiskey

- Komiskey has been the lead science officer on Miranda Reynolds’ corporate team for years. Even though she was initially kept in the dark over the situation on LV-426, she was fully supportive when she finally found out. She hadn’t believed in the stories and now that they have come true she cannot cope
- Dr. Komiskey was trapped in the Surgery Room which was automatically sealed when the base went into lockdown. She has woken up after having been facehugged and realizes she is doomed, but still has hope that the Company will save her.
- Komiskey pleads with the PCs to release her and offers to help them escape in the Starcub shuttle. She has the keycard on a lanyard around her neck and can explain its use. She won’t volunteer the fact that she has been facehugged, but if they make a successful MANIPULATION roll against her, she will admit it (stress level +1 for all who hear that).
- If asked why she came to Hadley’s Hope, Komiskey rambles on about how Reynolds inter-cepted a transmission from some corporate exec on Earth and decided to elbow in on the potential find. She assembled her inspection team off the books and came here.
- If the PCs release Dr. Komiskey, she will show the PCs the Xenomorph egg in the coolant compartment in the Medlab and the hyper-coolant spray canisters used to keep eggs inert.
- Later during the adventure, the Chestburster in Komiskey can [be birthed](#the-birth)
