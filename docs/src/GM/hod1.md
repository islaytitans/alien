- But disaster strikes! Alarm goes off - black hole gravitational pull has momentarily jumped causing storm of meteoroid strikes pummelling the hip and station
- Erebos thrusters stabilise (important for later) her but Cetorhina is caught in gravity shear
- Harvester lurches towards the black hole, knocking out NPC pilot - PCs require **PILOTING** regardless they crash into Erebos. If successful can chose 1 of 3 locations p16.
  - Random if fail and take 2 points of damage from violent crash
- Resulting crash Cetorhina will become entwined into Erebos and slowly be invaded by the Living Proto-Hive
- No evidence of the Living Hive aboard Erebos itself, it's dark - it's all behind the walls
- Give Story Card 'The Tell-tale heart' too PC with highest empathy
