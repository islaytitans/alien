### Opening

- There is external damage to a few decks - meteor hits no evidence of the living hive
- Erebos is dark - mostly. Lights come on in the main concourse as the docking port extends
- PCs can orbit the station, spacewalk to it or extend an umbilical to one of the docking ports
- But disaster strikes! Alarm goes off - black hole gravitational pull has momentarily jumped causing storm of meteoroid strikes pummelling the hip and station
- Erebos thrusters stabilise (important for later) her but Cetorhina is caught in gravity shear
- Harvester lurches towards the black hole, knocking out NPC pilot - PCs require **PILOTING** regardless they crash into Erebos. If successful can chose 1 of 3 locations p16.
  - Random if fail and take 2 points of damage from violent crash
- Resulting crash Cetorhina will become entwined into Erebos and slowly be invaded by the Living Proto-Hive
- No evidence of the Living Hive aboard Erebos itself, it's dark - it's all behind the walls
- Give Story Card 'The Tell-tale heart' too PC with highest empathy
- Time for them to explore, complete their agendas, repair the ship

TODO p18

### The Gift

- Out of a dark corridor something not human stirs
- It's a tuxedo cat called Adrien!
- It's brought them a "dead" **Squid-Baby** and places the **Passive** at the PCs feet. It's playing dead
- Squid Baby is like a pale octopus but has 4 arms, fast with a vice grip
- Squid Baby will bolt when least expected, scurrying off under the flooring
- The cat will now follow the PCs

### Streaker Part 1

- PCs feel like someone is following them, always out of sight
- Food / smokes / equipment might disappear
- This is Dr Webb and he's a little out of his mind p19
- Dr Webb doesn't allow himself to be seen more than a shadow until Act 2

### Cuddles The Starfish

- Looks like PCs have found their first survivor
- Someone is sleeping in the corner, facing away from them, back rising and falling as if asleep
- It isn't a man - it's a curled up **Passive** **Protomorph Trilobite** read;
  - With a low guttural moan, the dark fetal man begins to rise his back shifting as thick tentacles spill out in front of him
  - You don't know what you are looking at. With no arms, legs, or head, this thing is clearly not a man at all, but rather a monstrous seven-limbed starfish
  - Rising to its full man-sized height, it turns towards you, revealing a maw of scissor teeth surrounded by blossoming fleshy petals. Each petal reveals what looks like a swollen eye.
  - Something launches from the creature's mouth and scatters across the floor at your feet - the gnawed fleshy skull of it's last victim
- Cuddles attacking the nearest character to give it a fatal hug
- If wounded it will flee but then stalk the PCs from a distance, harrying them when they are at their weakest
- During the fight they can be [ambushed](#watch-the-world-burn)

### Riot Control

- Two Corrections Androids are moving through the station culling Protomorphs and wraping up escaped prisoners
- Encountering PCs their eyes flash red to ID them, they look for Barcodes on the back of PCs necks
  - Hedenstrom barcode on the back of his neck will cause confusion as its not in the system
- With MUTHUR offline the androids' reasoning is limited, believing they could be scavengers they take the PCs to the Cellblock on Deck F for questioning later
- If PCs demand to see whose in charge the androids can be convinced to take them to the Warden, whose hiding in the Security Office on Deck F
- On the way they've be [ambushed](#watch-the-world-burn)
- The PCs can then learn anything I want them to know about how the station got to this point from the Survivors

### Watch The World Burn

- While under escort from the androids or facing off against Cuddles the PCs are ambushed vt Wicks' revenge squad
- Cecil and 6 **Active** Conscripted Convicts
- They will take the PCs to Wicks' Hideout in Starboard Machine Room on Dech H to meet the prison boss herself

### The Howl

- A shriek echoes throughout the station, subsiding in the distance **+1 Stress Level**
- After a pause, the PCs hear a howling reply from Adrien the cat
- One direction is **Passive** **Protomorph Deacon** and the other is Adrien and they're both heading towards the PCs
- After a few attacks a shrill whistle will resonate in everyone's skulls - not ears
- The Deacon will pull back and sit in the corner
- A Perfected will step out, handing their hand across the Deacon's head
- They'll beckon a PC without malice and will psionically impart information
