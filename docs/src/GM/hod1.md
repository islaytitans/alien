## Erebos

- All lights are out, unidentified clanging noises echo, the reactor hums sporadically, station's hull groans as marchinery shifts and is replaced with Living Proto-Hive behind the walls for Act 1
- Gravity - parts are gravity free, as is space. Charactes in Zero-G need **Mobility** to move effectively. Failed roll means they are floundering.
- Space-workaround - There are many obstacles but there are many airlocks. PCs may need to go outside to circumvent things. Taking **1 Rad per Turn** from the black hole
- Radiation Zones - Human or Android entering strong radiation must make **Virulence 6 Sickness** roll, weak radiation **Virulence 4 Sickness**
  - become tainted by thge Hessdalen Lights p61, becoming an Abomination p69 within **1 Shift**

- Evolution - Erebose becomes less machine and more monster through Acts.

## Erebos post Act 1

- After Act 1 Erebos will slowly change apperance to the smooth-sculpted and ribbed free-forms of a Xenomorph hive
- The Living Proto-Hive is biomechanical honeycombed organism that supports protomorphic lifeforms
- Fleshy black veins and tendons grow, transmorgrifying mteal supports into skeleton structures and powerlines into arteries to pump plasmatic energy
- p62 for more on what the Living Proto-Hive can do

## Chute

- Vertical travel is through the central Zero-G Chute between Deck B to Deck J
- There are no lifts, only airlocks, junctions and ladders
- Every airlock and every 20m of Chute there are emergency doors and control panels
- p27 for obstacles table in the Chute

## Deck A - Astrometric Observatory

### Science Station

- Room is a wreck and dark, equipment destroyed and looks like someone was living here for weeks by half eaten rations and dirty clothes
- Ambient Energy Collectors
  - Cetorhina's batteries can be connected for recharging
- Storm Shields
  - Sheilds are closed with one cycling open and close 5 inches. Opening them will reveal a 360 view of the Black Hole in all its splendor
  - Once opened Viewports reveal ancient hieroglyphics phosphorus paint with some English translations. Anyone with Geholgod training will recognise them from Star Teacher artificats discovered on Arcturus
  - Transations read "Humankind must be obliterated" and "Do not allow perfection" one in German says "Border Bombers?" p28 Clerke's Clues
- Sensor Terminal
  - Multi-screen terminal recording gravitational waves.
  - Also relayes encrypted audio transmissions drawn to the black hole sending tha data to MUTHUR on Deck C, can only be listened to at her interface terminal

### Lattice Corridor, Personnel Airlock 00

- 10m tall tower exposed to space only means to get between observatory to the rest of Erebos
- Someone has been using the Observatory Airlock as a bathroom

## Mandatory Events

### Opening

- On approach to Erebos only greeted by the automated docking signal
- There is external damage to a few decks - meteor hits no evidence of the living hive
- Erebos is dark - mostly. Lights come on in the main concourse as the docking port extends
- PCs can orbit the station, spacewalk to it or extend an umbilical to one of the docking ports
- But disaster strikes! Alarm goes off - black hole gravitational pull has momentarily jumped causing storm of meteoroid strikes pummelling the hip and station
- Erebos thrusters stabilise (important for later) her but Cetorhina is caught in gravity shear
- Harvester lurches towards the black hole, knocking out NPC pilot - PCs require **PILOTING** regardless they crash into Erebos. If successful can chose 1 of 3 locations p16.
  - Random if fail and take 2 points of damage from violent crash
- Resulting crash Cetorhina will become entwined into Erebos and slowly be invaded by the Living Proto-Hive
- No evidence of the Living Hive aboard Erebos itself, it's dark - it's all behind the walls
- Give Story Card 'The Tell-tale heart' too PC with highest empathy
- [Time for them to explore, complete their agendas, repair the ship](#assess-the-cetorhina)

### Assess the Cetorhina

- The meteorides are actually Living Proto-Hive Nodes that are now embedding themselves in the hull
  - They will root their way through the deck an into the systems and eventually FTL drive
- Repairs to the ship will reveal living tendrills beginning to grow threoughout it - melding it with Erebos
- Since Cetorhina is mangled and locked into Erebos superstructure PCs don't have what they need to free the shiup
  - Grey will stay with the ship to do repairs if not a PC
- Agendas should encourage the PCs to exploree the station / find out what happened

#### Power Cells

- The crash drained the batteries causing them to corrode
- Replacement energy cells 1m tall barrels with harness Straps **Weight 3** can be found in Terminal 01 and the Lower Tower
- The Pcs can repair them **Heavy Machinery** and fire up the plasma distillery on Trawling Arm 01 to recharge them p40, p44, p41
- Ship will need 3 cells for engine ignition and take **1 Turn** to reisntall cell on the ship

#### Truster Compression Coil

- Thrusters won't work without it
- PCs will need to remove a working Compression Cell fgrom one of the stations external thrusters located
  - near the Visitor Docking Port on Deck D p34
  - the comms Tower on Deck H p44
  - Boiler room on Dec j p46
- Takes **1 Turn** to remove or install compression coil

#### Cutting Tools

- Cumbersome power tools **Weight 3** and/or EVA Pods are needed to cut the Cetorhina free from the superstructure
- Tools can be found in the Machine Room and Plasma Relay Stations p41
- EVA Pods are equiped with similar tool arms that can do the job in half the time. They're located throughout the station

### The Gift

- Out of a dark corridor something not human stirs
- It's a tuxedo cat called Adrien!
- It's brought them a "dead" **Squid-Baby** and places the **Passive** at the PCs feet. It's playing dead
- Squid Baby is like a pale octopus but has 4 arms, fast with a vice grip
- Squid Baby will bolt when least expected, scurrying off under the flooring
- The cat will now follow the PCs

### Cuddles The Starfish

- Looks like PCs have found their first survivor
- Someone is sleeping in the corner, facing away from them, back rising and falling as if asleep
- It isn't a man - it's a curled up **Passive** **Protomorph Trilobite** read;
  - With a low guttural moan, the dark fetal man begins to rise his back shifting as thick tentacles spill out in front of him
  - You don't know what you are looking at. With no arms, legs, or head, this thing is clearly not a man at all, but rather a monstrous seven-limbed starfish
  - Rising to its full man-sized height, it turns towards you, revealing a maw of scissor teeth surrounded by blossoming fleshy petals. Each petal reveals what looks like a swollen eye.
  - Something launches from the creature's mouth and scatters across the floor at your feet - the gnawed fleshy skull of it's last victim
- Cuddles attacking the nearest character to give it a fatal hug
- If wounded it will flee but then stalk the PCs from a distance, harrying them when they are at their weakest
- During the fight they can be [ambushed](#watch-the-world-burn)

### Riot Control

- Two Corrections Androids are moving through the station culling Protomorphs and wraping up escaped prisoners
- Encountering PCs their eyes flash red to ID them, they look for Barcodes on the back of PCs necks
  - Hedenstrom barcode on the back of his neck will cause confusion as its not in the system
- With MUTHUR offline the androids' reasoning is limited, believing they could be scavengers they take the PCs to the Cellblock on Deck F for questioning later
- If PCs demand to see whose in charge the androids can be convinced to take them to the Warden, whose hiding in the Security Office on Deck F
- On the way they've be [ambushed](#watch-the-world-burn)
- The PCs can then learn anything I want them to know about how the station got to this point from the Survivors

### Watch The World Burn

- While under escort from the androids or facing off against Cuddles the PCs are ambushed by Wicks' revenge squad
- Cecil and 6 **Active** Conscripted Convicts
- They will take the PCs to Wicks' Hideout in Starboard Machine Room on Dech H to meet the prison boss herself

### The Howl

- A shriek echoes throughout the station, subsiding in the distance **+1 Stress Level**
- After a pause, the PCs hear a howling reply from Adrien the cat
- One direction is **Passive** **Protomorph Deacon** and the other is Adrien and they're both heading towards the PCs
- After a few attacks a shrill whistle will resonate in everyone's skulls - not ears
- The Deacon will pull back and sit in the corner
- A Perfected will step out, handing their hand across the Deacon's head
- They'll beckon a PC without malice and will psionically impart information
- Read The Offer p63
